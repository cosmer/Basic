Another weak \nridge of high pressure follows for tonight and early Wednesday. \nLow pressure arrives for Wednesday and Wednesday night, \nproducing rain for much of the area, but snow and mixed\nprecipitation for the foothills and the mountains. Colder and \nunsettled weather lingers behind this system for Thursday and \nFriday.\n\n&&\n\n.NEAR TERM /UNTIL 6 PM THIS EVENING/...\n\n640 AM...Minor ESTF update to reflect the current mesonet in\nnear term grids. \n\nPrev Disc...\nAt 07z...a weak north-south ridge of high pressure was draped\nacross the area. A 996 millibar low was centered over the\nnorthern Great Lakes with a trailing cold front through the\nlakes and upper midwest. GOES infrared imagery showed broken \nareas of warm air advection clouds crossing the region at\nmoment. Along with the clouds some stratus and fog had developed\nover some of the interior valleys. For today...the warm air\nadvection clouds will lift to our north by later this morning.\nSunshine and a southwest flow will allow temperatures to warm a\ngood five to ten degrees above average for the date. Highs will\nrange from the 40s across the mountains to lower and mid 50s\nelsewhere. Late today the surface low will pass across Quebec\nwith the trailing cold front dropping southeast into the area \nwith a few more clouds. Any spotty rain or snow shower activity \nwith the boundary should be limited to mountain sections.\n\n&&\n\n.SHORT TERM /6 PM THIS EVENING THROUGH 6 PM WEDNESDAY/...\nThe weak front will settle to our south tonight with mainly \nclear skies allowing some patchy valley stratus and fog to\ndevelop once again. Lows will range from the mid 20s to lower\n30s. On Wednesday...a quiet start to the day under a weak ridge\nof high pressure. However...warm air advection clouds arrive by\nafternoon ahead of the next storm system approaching from the\nGreat Lakes. Onshore flow may also introduce some low clouds to\nsouthern and coastal sections by late morning. Light overrunning\nprecipitation develops from southwest to northeast during the\nmid to late afternoon hours. The forecast column should\ninitially be warm enough for rain. The exception will be near\nthe international border where a mix of snow, sleet and rain is\nlikely. Mountain sections will likely see a coating to as much \nas an inch of new snow and sleet by early evening. Highs will be\nin the 40s...except in the upper 30s near the international\nborder.\n\n&&\n\n.LONG TERM /WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY/...\n*** Impactful Winter Storm for Thanksgiving Morning Travel ***\n\nUpper level pattern is looking more active for the last week of  \nNovember and the beginning of December. A powerful storm system \nwill be in the process of crossing northern New England \nWednesday night into Thanksgiving Day. Secondary cyclogenesis \nshould occur over the Gulf of Maine Wednesday night, moving \nquickly east of the area. Much of the QPF will be over by \ndaybreak Thanksgiving, but this storm has a large footprint as \nfar as wrap-around moisture and wind fields are concerned, \ntherefore there will be lingering effects throughout the day. On\nthe whole looking for perhaps 4-6\" of fresh snow for the \nInternational border and the higher terrain, with much smaller \namounts as one moves down elevation and p-type mixes with sleet,\nfreezing rain, and rain in the foothills. The coastal plain \nstill looks to get mainly rain from this event, with storm \ntotals around a quarter to a half an inch. As for the freezing \nrain, this would be the perhaps most impactful to \ntravel...however only negligible, patchy amounts are expected \nunder 4,000 ft. \n\nAs mentioned the storm will wrap up by the morning hours for\nmost  spots as drying from the SW arrives. Precipitation near \nthe low center/coast will see mostly rain as the system exits \neast into the Atlantic south of Nova Scotia. Upslope portions of\nthe mountains will continue to see snowfall into the afternoon \nhours. We'll see clouds decreasing from the southwest during the\nday, with temperatures reaching the lower 30s along the \nCanadian border to the low to mid 40s south. The main thing to \nnote will be the gusty winds expected as the storm passes. These\ncurrently look to be around 25-30 mph, but would not be \nsurprised if things change and a wind advisory was needed. \n\nThursday night will be cold with strong CAA and winds remaining  \ngusty. Temperatures will be in the upper teens north to the mid \n20s south. Friday will also be windy with the tight pressure \ngradient remaining. This is due to the Thanksgiving system \nbecoming blocked downstream and deepened to a ~970mb storm south\nof Newfoundland. This will continue to pull frigid Arctic air \ninto northern New England, with highs in the 20s and 30s Friday \nthrough early next week. Also expecting some extremely chilly \nnights, with overnight lows around 7 to 15 across the north, and\nin the lower 20s near the coast. \n\nThe next system to watch will move out of the Great Plains and  \nbegin affecting New England Sunday night. Currently the storm is\npassing south of us, which would give us snow across the entire\narea, especially with the cold air already in place.\n\n&&\n\n.AVIATION /12Z TUESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...\nShort Term /through Wednesday/...Sct MVFR and IFR in cigs and\nfog through 12z this morning and again btw 06z and 12z Wed otw VFR\nexpected. Widespread MVFR with areas of IFR developing aft 18z\nWed in RA and fog...with a mix of SN PL and RA for mtn sections.  \n\nLong Term...Expect widespread IFR conditions Thursday morning as\na warm front lift through the area. A mix of snow and sleet is \nexpected for the mountains with rain along the coast. Snow and \nMVFR conditions will continue along the Canadian border through\nThursday as upslope snow showers develop. Conditions will clear\nwith VFR returning late Thursday as high pressure builds in for\nthe weekend.\n\n&&\n\n.MARINE...\nShort Term /through Wednesday/...SW flow will increase ahead of\na weak cold front late today...but we should stay below SCA's\neven on the open waters. Onshore winds develop and increase\nWednesday afternoon in advance of the next storm system. The\nopen waters could approach SCAs towards evening. \n\nLong Term...A gale watch may be needed Thursday into Friday as \na strong pressure gradient remains over the waters...mainly for\nthe outer waters and Penobscot Bay.\n\n&&\n\n.TIDES/COASTAL FLOODING...\nHigh astronomical tides will continue today. However...there \nshould be little in the way of surge for the late morning high \ntide today as winds and seas will remain rather light.\n\n&&\n\n.GYX WATCHES/WARNINGS/ADVISORIES...\nME...None.\nNH...None.\nMARINE...None.\n\n&&\n\n$$\n\nES\n"
    static let ex2 = "\n000\nFXUS66 KMTR 261203\nAFDMTR\n\nArea Forecast Discussion\nNational Weather Service San Francisco Bay Area\n403 AM PST Tue Nov 26 2019\n\n.SYNOPSIS...A strong cold front will bring widespread rain to the\nentire region Tuesday afternoon and evening. Strong and gusty \nsouth to southwest winds will precede the front late Tuesday. \nWinds will then switch to the west to northwest and remain gusty \nthrough Tuesday night. Showers, lowering snow levels, and possible\nthunderstorms are forecast for Wednesday. Showers will taper off \nfrom north to south on Thanksgiving. Below normal temperatures are\nexpected for the remainder of the week and nighttime freezing \ntemperatures are possible later in the week, especially Thursday \nnight. Another system may bring more rain to the region next \nweekend. \n\n&&\n\n.DISCUSSION...As of 3:31 AM PST Tuesday...Winds have mostly \nsubsided throughout much of the region over the past 6-10 hours, \nespecially in the valleys and near sea level. There remain some \nisolated gusts in the 20-30 mph range in the higher elevations, \nallowing for near-critical fire weather conditions to continue at \nthis time. Expect these north to northeast winds in the hills to \ncontinue diminishing through sunrise.\n\nFire weather concerns will quickly disappear over the next 24 \nhours an midlatitude cyclone will undergo bombogenesis (24 mb drop\nin 24 hours) as it approaches the California-Oregon coast. This \nstorm will bring rain, snow, wind, cold temperatures, and the \nthreat of thunderstorms to the region over the next several days.\n\nFirst, the wind concerns. The latest 06Z 3 km NAM shows pressure \ndropping from 1000 mb at 12Z today down to 970 mb at 00Z Tuesday. \nThis rapid pressure drop will allow for surface winds to increase \nthroughout much of coastal Oregon as well coastal northern and \ncentral California through the next 24 hours. Locally, the San \nFrancisco Bay Area and central California coast will see south to \nsouthwest winds increase during the afternoon hours ahead of the \ncold front that will subsequently sweep through the area during \nthe evening hours. These strong, gusty south-southwesterly winds \nwill be sustained in the 20 to 30 mph range with gusts of 45 to 50\nmph, and will primarily impact coastal locations as well as the \nhills and mountains surrounding the Bay Area. And behind the \nfrontal passage in the evening, winds will become west to\nnorthwest around 15 to 25 mph with gusts to 45 mph, and remain \ngusty through the overnight hours. As a result, a Wind Advisory is\nin effect from 4 PM PST Tuesday to 4 AM PST Wednesday for the \nPacific shoreline from Sonoma through Monterey County, as well as \nfor the higher elevations including the North Bay Mountains, Santa\nCruz Mountains, East Bay Hills and Diablo Range, the Santa \nLucias, and Interior San Benito and Monterey County.\n\nPrecipitation chances will initially increase in the North Bay \naround mid-day Tuesday, extending south through the afternoon \nhours to the core Bay Area, and to the Monterey area in the \nevening. Rainfall intensity will start off light to moderate, but \nthen become briefly heavy as the cold front comes in from the \nnorthwest sometime around 4-7 pm in the North Bay (per the 3 km \nNAM) and 6-9 pm in San Francisco, Oakland, and San Jose. While the\nheaviest rainfall intensity will only occur during a brief period\nof time, it is very well possible rates may exceed 0.5 inches per\nhour in northern Sonoma County over the Kincade Fire burn area. \nConsequently, there are concerns about flash flooding and debris \nflows on this very recent burn scar. Will be issuing a Flash Flood\nWatch for the burn area and locations immediately downstream. \nIt's quite remarkable how fast we will swing from elevated fire \nweather conditions to flash flood/debris flow concerns in less \nthan a 24 hour period.\n\nAs the upper level low drops southward, temperatures at 500 mb \nwill plummet from -17 deg C from now to -32 deg C by mid-day \nWednesday. Most unstable CAPE values will rise to the 200-400 \nJ/kg range throughout most of the Bay Area and central California \ncoast. Thus, there is a very good possibility that there will be \nnumerous showers and even scattered thunderstorms from late \nTuesday night through Wednesday, and possibly into Thanksgiving \nDay.\n\nThe cold air advection will also allow for snow levels to drop \nthroughout the state. As the scattered showers continue on \nWednesday, the Santa Lucias and Diablo Range will likely see the \nprecipitation fall in the form of snow above 3,000-3,500 ft. Snow \nlevels will continue dropping overnight Wednesday and into \nThanksgiving Day to as low as 2,000 ft in some places. Big \nquestion at that point if the showers will continue. At this \npoint, at least several inches of accumulating snow seems very \nlikely above 3,000 ft in the Santa Lucias and possibly in the \nDiablo Range. Can't rule out some light snowfall in the peaks of \nthe Santa Cruz Mountains as well. Will be launching a Winter \nWeather Advisory for the Santa Lucia Mountains and Los Padres \nNational Forest above 2,500 ft as a result of the forecast \naccumulating snowfall. Hikers, campers, and outdoor enthusiasts \nwith plans in the mountains above Big Sur on Wednesday and \nThursday are urged to closely monitor the weather conditions as \nwinter-like conditions are likely climbing with elevation.\nThanksgiving travelers throughout the Western United States should\nclosely monitor the weather as travel impacts over the next\nseveral days are expected.\n\nCold temperatures will impact many populated areas by late week \nwith near-freezing or below-freezing overnight low temperatures. \nThe coldest temperatures will likely be observed in the North Bay \nValleys with 20s and low 30s likely by Thursday or Friday morning.\nThe Santa Clara Valley, East Bay Valleys, and Salinas Valley may \nalso see temperatures drop to the low-to-middle 30s on Friday \nmorning when clearing will be more pronounced. Frost and/or freeze\nheadlines may be necessary in the coming days.\n\nThe unsettled pattern will continue into this upcoming weekend as\nanother storm system will begin impacting central and northern \nCalifornia on Saturday.\n\n&&\n\n.AVIATION...as of 4:05 AM PST Tuesday...Quiet this morning ahead \nof an approaching weather system. Clouds increasing in the \nafternoon in the Bay Area becoming MVFR cigs. Light rain initially\nbecoming briefly heavy early this evening. Frontal system should \nbe through the Bay Area after 06Z with rain turning to light to \nmoderate showers. Southerly winds this afternoon reaching its \nmaximum speed just ahead of the frontal passage. Could see gusts \nto 30 kt at the surface but gusts to 50 kt above the surface will \ncause LLWS. Model guidance suggest a 20-25 percent chance of \nthunderstorms during the evening hours. \n\nVicinity of KSFO...VFR this morning. MVFR cigs after 20Z with rain\nbeginning shortly afterwards. A brief period of heavy rain \nsometime between 00Z and 06Z as the front passes. Bases initially\nat 3000 ft but lowering to 1000 to 1500 ft during heavier rains. \nLight northwest winds becoming south to southeast after 20Z. Winds\nup to 20 kt with gusts to 30 kt just ahead of frontal passage.\nWinds above the surface could be as high as 50 kt causing LLWS. \nWinds switching to southwest after 06Z. Showers and a possibility \nof thunderstorms in the post-frontal environment. \n\nSFO Bridge Approach...Similar to KSFO.\n\nMonterey Bay Terminals...VFR for today. Rain could arrive by 00Z\nwith cigs gradually lowering to MVFR. Brief period of moderate to\nheavy rain between 04Z and 08Z with southerly winds gusting to 20\nkt. Winds above the surface could be as high as 40 kt causing\nLLWS. Rain turning to showers after 08-09Z and winds becoming\nsouthwest and decreasing.\n\n&&\n\n.MARINE...as of 03:38 AM PST Tuesday...A surface low will deepen\nrapidly off the Oregon coast today and tonight. An associated cold\nfront will move across the coastal waters early tonight. Strong\nsoutherly winds ahead of the front will bring gale force winds to\nthe northern and outer waters.  There is a slight chance of\nthunderstorms tonight into Wednesday morning. Winds will slowly\ndecrease on Wednesday as the low moves into Oregon. The strong\nwinds will generate large swells that will peak on Wednesday.\n\n&&\n\n.MTR WATCHES/WARNINGS/ADVISORIES...\n     .Tday...Wind Advisory...CAZ006-505-507-509-511-512-517-518\n             Flash Flood Watch...CAZ506-507\n             SCA...Pigeon Pt to Pt Pinos 0-10 nm until 6 AM\n             SCA...Pigeon Pt to Pt Pinos 0-10 nm from 4 PM\n             SCA...Pt Arena to Pigeon Pt 10-60 nm until 2 PM\n             GLW...Pt Arena to Pigeon Pt 10-60 nm from 2 PM\n             SCA...Pt Arena to Pt Reyes 0-10 nm\n             SCA...Pt Reyes to Pigeon Pt 0-10 nm\n             SCA...Pigeon Pt to Pt Piedras Blancas 10-60 nm\n             GLW...SF Bay from 4 PM\n             GLW...Pt Arena to Pt Reyes 0-10 nm from 4 PM\n             GLW...Pt Reyes to Pigeon Pt 0-10 nm from 4 PM\n             GLW...Pigeon Pt to Pt Piedras Blancas 10-60 nm from 4 PM\n             SCA...Rough Bar Advisory for SF Bar\n             SCA...Pt Pinos to Pt Piedras Blancas 0-10 nm\n\n&&\n\n$$\n\nPUBLIC FORECAST: Rowe\nAVIATION: W Pi\nMARINE: W Pi\n\nVisit us at www.weather.gov/sanfrancisco\n\nFollow us on Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube at:\nwww.facebook.com/nwsbayarea\nwww.twitter.com/nwsbayarea\nwww.youtube.com/nwsbayarea\n"
    static let ex3 = "\n000\nFXUS61 KGYX 011204\nAFDGYX\n\nArea Forecast Discussion\nNational Weather Service Gray ME\n704 AM EST Sun Dec 1 2019\n\n.SYNOPSIS...\nLow pressure tracks south of Cape Cod tonight and shifts into\nthe Gulf of Monday and intensifies, before exiting into the\nmaritimes late Tuesday. This system will bring significant snow\nto parts of the region late today through Tuesday. Cold weather\ncontinues through the end of the week.\n\n&&\n\n.NEAR TERM /TODAY/... \n7AM UPDATE...\nHave updated the forecast to pull in early morning temperature\nobservations. Clouds finally dissipated up north allowing\nBerlin, NH to drop to 2 below. No significant changes to the\ncurrent forecast.\n\nORIGINAL DISCUSSION...\nCentral axis of Canadian high pressure is crossing our area this\nmorning. Meanwhile to our west a large upper level low is\nspinning east through the Midwest and toward the Great Lakes.\nAhead of this low we will find ourselves beneath a shortwave \nridge axis today with mostly clear skies becoming cloudier from\nsouthwest to northeast as the day goes on and moisture streaming\nnortheast ahead of the low reaches our area. Temperatures today\nwill top out right around freezing for most areas. Although\ntemperatures aloft are warming, we will start out quite cold and\nincreasing clouds will limit heating.\n\n&&\n\n.SHORT TERM /SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY/...\n...COMPLEX WINTER STORM WILL IMPACT THE AREA THROUGH TUESDAY...\n\nThe forecast for tonight through Tuesday is complex and still \nwrought with uncertainty in some aspects. We expect a long \nduration snowfall event featuring primarily two rounds of \nheavier snowfall. The first round of heavy snowfall tonight has \nfairly high confidence associated with it, while the next round \nMonday night into Tuesday has much more uncertainty. We have \nissued Winter Storm Warnings and Winter Weather Advisories for \nareas most likely to be affected by the heavier snowfall \ntonight. Meanwhile, areas further east which have a better \nchance of being affected by Monday night and Tuesday's snowfall \nhave a Winter Storm Watch for the potential for heavy snow.\n\nAs the large upper level low pressure system moves out of the\nMidwest and through the lower Great Lakes a new surface low will\nform off the Mid Atlantic coast and track slowly toward the Gulf\nof Maine. Expect an initial round of warm/moist advection \nsnowfall to lift northward through southern New England and into\nsouthern New Hampshire tonight. This will provide the bulk of\nthe snowfall for New Hampshire with 6 to 10 inches expected in\nsouthern New Hampshire. Preceding very dry air mass will likely\ncreate a sharp cut off in the northward extent of snowfall. The\nsnow should decrease in intensity Monday morning as the moist\nadvection shifts eastward. However, as the surface low moves\neast and the upper level low hangs back to the west, we expect a\nstream of moisture and lift to persist across southwest Maine\nand much of New Hampshire through the day on Monday.\nMeteorologists call this a TROWAL, or trough of warm air aloft,\nand it forms as a connection between the low level moisture\nstream east of the surface low feeding back toward the upper\nlevel low. Within this area we will likely see persistent light\nsnowfall across the southern half of our forecast area.\n\nBy Monday evening the upper level low will move east toward the\nGulf of Maine, catching up to the lingering surface low. As it\ndoes so models are indicating a renewed round of heavier\nsnowfall is possible along and to the northwest of the low.\nWinds may also increase within this band of snow as well. There\nis still a good deal of variation among the models on where to \nset up this band of snowfall and how intense it will be, though \nthere is broad agreement that it will form. Best estimate at \nthis time is that this will affect the coastal plain of Maine \nroughly from the Portland area northeast toward Bangor. This \nsecond round of heavier snowfall could produce another 6 inches \nor more of snow. Again, though, there is considerable \nuncertainty on where this will set up and how intense it will \nbe. For that reason, the area we expect to be affected is \ncurrently under a Winter Storm Watch.\n\nAs for storm total snowfall amounts we must consider the fact\nthat this includes snowfall from Sunday evening through\nTuesday... nearly 60 hours. This inserts a high amount of\nuncertainty in the total amounts, and it will make it hard for\nobservers to measure as well due to compaction. For such long \nduration winter weather events, we have a higher 9 inch \ncriteria for winter storm warnings. Although for this forecast\nwe attempted to hone in on the two primary periods of heavier\nsnowfall with Warnings and Watches issued for areas expected to\nsee 6 or more inches within those shorter periods of time. With\nlight snow continuing for most of the time from Sunday night\nthrough Tuesday we can expect that even as snow intensity wanes,\nsnowy travel conditions will persist.\n\n&&\n\n.LONG TERM /TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY/...\n500 MB pattern across NOAM stays with the trend toward troughing\nthru the week, as upstream and downstream ridges stay in place.\nOverall this will make for below normals temps, with some fast \nmoving waves that will bring a couple bouts of snow showers, \nbut the persistent downslope flow should make them most likely \nin the mountains. There are signs of our upstream block over \nthe Pacific breaking down, which in turn allows Atlantic ridging\nto build back toward the east coast early next week, which if \nit pans out, would mean a warming trend. \n\nDeep sfc cyclone will finally be moving N and E through the \nmaritimes Tue night, so expect some clearing outside the\nmountains, but still a little on the breezy side with lows \nmostly in the teens to around 20. Another 500 MB wave approaches\nWed and moves across the CWA Wed night and Thu. A sfc low \ndevelops from this system, but far enough offshore where it's \nonly impacts will be clouds, but the the upper low could produce\nsome SHSN in the mountains on Thu. Highs Wed and Thu will be \nsimilar, generally ranging from the low 30s in the N, to near 40\nin the S, with overnight lows Thu morning generally ranging \nfrom around 20 in the n to the mid 20s in the S. \n\nYet another fast moving trough could bring SHSN to the entire\nCWA Fri night, with a blast of colder air for Saturday. A\nwarming trend is then possible Sunday into early next week. \n\n&&\n\n.AVIATION /09Z SUNDAY THROUGH THURSDAY/...\nShort Term...VFR today but will see increasing clouds and\nlowering ceilings beginning in southern New Hampshire this\nevening. Expect a period of snow, possibly heavy at times,\naffecting the Manchester, Concord, and Portsmouth areas early\nMonday morning. Snow intensity weakens and spreads to a broader\narea on Monday, with another round of heavier snow possible for\nthe coastal plain of Maine Monday night into Tuesday.\n\nLong Term...Mainly VFR outside of the mtns Wed thru Friday. KHIE\nwill likely see some periods of MVFR in SHSN. \n\n&&\n\n.MARINE...\nShort Term...Low pressure forming off the Mid Atlantic coast and\ntracking into the Gulf of Maine will bring gale force winds\nbeginning early Monday morning and lasting into Tuesday morning.\nCasco Bay will be somewhat protected from these winds and will\nlikely only reach 30KT gusts or so.\n\nLong Term...Lingering SCA conditions expected Tue night, but \nexpect sub-SCA Wed into Thu morning, with SCA possible late Thu\nand Thu night. \n\n&&\n\n.TIDES/COASTAL FLOODING...\nAlthough tides will be near their astronomical minimum for the\nmonth, the strong system in the Gulf of Maine will bring\nbuilding waves and a storm surge. The combination could lead to\nperiods of minor splash over late Monday into Tuesday.\n\n&&\n\n.GYX WATCHES/WARNINGS/ADVISORIES...\nME...Winter Storm Watch from 1 PM EST this afternoon through \n     Tuesday afternoon for MEZ018-019-021>028.\nNH...Winter Weather Advisory from 1 PM this afternoon to 7 AM EST \n     Tuesday for NHZ003>006-009.\n     Winter Storm Warning from 4 PM this afternoon to 7 AM EST \n     Tuesday for NHZ007-008-010>015.\nMARINE...Small Craft Advisory from 4 AM Monday to 6 PM EST Tuesday for \n     ANZ153.\n     Gale Warning from 4 AM Monday to noon EST Tuesday for \n     ANZ150>152-154.\n\n&&\n\n$$\n\nNEAR TERM...Kimble\nSHORT TERM...Kimble\nLONG TERM...Cempa\n"
