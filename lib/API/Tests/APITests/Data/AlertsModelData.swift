        "description": "This product covers EAST CENTRAL FLORIDA\n\n**Stationary Dorian Expected to Finally Start moving North-Northwest\nLater Today**\n\n\nNEW INFORMATION\n---------------\n\n* CHANGES TO WATCHES AND WARNINGS:\n- None\n\n* CURRENT WATCHES AND WARNINGS:\n- A Storm Surge Warning and Hurricane Warning are in effect for\nCoastal Volusia, Indian River, Martin, Northern Brevard,\nSouthern Brevard, and St. Lucie\n- A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for Inland Volusia,\nNorthern Lake, Okeechobee, Orange, Osceola, Seminole, and\nSouthern Lake\n\n* STORM INFORMATION:\n- About 170 miles southeast of Cape Canaveral FL or about 110\nmiles east of Stuart FL\n- 26.9N 78.4W\n- Storm Intensity 120 mph\n- Movement Stationary\n\nSITUATION OVERVIEW\n------------------\n\nHurricane Dorian has remained nearly stationary since Monday morning\njust north of Grand Bahama Island, or about 110 miles east of Stuart\nin Martin County. Dorian is expected to resume a slow northwestward\nmotion this morning, then turn north-northwest and move parallel to the\neast coast of central Florida at a faster forward speed later today\nand Wednesday.\n\nPersons in central Florida should not be lulled into complacency\nbecause weather conditions have yet to significantly worsen! This is\nbecause the center of Dorian has been stationary since stalling out\naround this time on Monday.\n\nAs Dorian makes its closest approach to the area later today and\ntonight, impacts being felt in the coastal counties of Martin, Saint\nLucie, Indian River, Brevard and Volusia will worsen. Residents can\nexpect increasing winds and gusty squalls as well as continued\nworsening of ongoing dangerous sea and surf conditions.\n\nThere will be considerable impacts and damage to coastal areas with\neffects starting to be felt over inland areas as well. The threat for\ndamaging gusty winds, especially in increasing squalls, as well as\nlife-threatening storm surge remains high! Severe beach erosion and\ntopping or breaching of the dunes from water runup during high tide,\ncoupled with storm surge will increase.\n\nThe latest forecast for Dorian keeps the eye of Dorian about 60 to\n70 miles offshore east central Florida at its closest approach. This\nis a little farther than indicated by earlier forecasts. However, any\ndeviation west of the forecast track would bring stronger winds,\nhigher seas and surf, and heavier rain to the Florida east coast.\n\nThe threat for damaging winds will increase for the coastal counties\ntoday. Tropical storm force winds between 40 and 45 mph, with gusts\nto near hurricane force, will spread north from coastal Martin and\nSaint Lucie Counties into Indian River and Brevard Counties by this\nafternoon and evening, and coastal Volusia County later tonight.\n\nPersons along the coast in Martin, Saint Lucie and Indian River\nCounties, will need to remain in shelter until conditions improve late\ntonight. Father north in southern Brevard County, sheltering in place\nwill need to commence later today. Residents of northern Brevard and\nVolusia Counties will have a few hours through late morning, for some\nlast-minute safety preparations before needing to shelter there.\n\nInland communities will also have an increased threat for tropical\nstorm force winds, mainly in eastern Okeechobee, Osceola, Orange, and\nSeminole Counties, as well as inland Volusia County. Increasing gusty\nwinds will reach Okeechobee and Osceola Counties by this afternoon,\nand farther north this overnight into Wednesday.\n\nThe threat for life-threatening storm surge also remains high, and\nsevere erosion of the beaches and dune lines is a near certainty! The\ncombination of surge and high astronomical tides will cause severe\nrunup of waves and water, resulting in inundation of many coastal\nlocations. Surge may reach 4 to 7 feet above ground near the coast.\nThe surge of north winds as the hurricane moves parallel to the coast\nwill cause water to pile up on the Intracoastal Waterway with coastal\nflooding possible in low lying areas along the river.\n\nLarge battering waves and higher than normal tides on top of the surge\nwill add to the destructive force of the water during several high\ntide cycles. Entering the water can be deadly as there will be very\nlarge breaking waves building up to 10 feet, in addition to numerous\nstrong rip currents.\n\nHeavy rainfall is forecast over east central Florida from Dorian, with\ntotal amounts of 4 to 8 inches over the coastal counties and 2 to 6\ninches inland, with maximum isolated rainfall amounts up to 10 inches\nalong the coast. While isolated urban and poor drainage flooding will\nbe possible inland, it will be even more likely near the coast.\nFlooding and high water levels on area rivers such as the Saint Johns\nRiver will be aggravated by any additional rainfall\n\nWhile threat remains low, isolated tornadoes will be possible in\nsqualls as they move onshore along the coast this evening through\nTuesday.\n\n\nPOTENTIAL IMPACTS\n-----------------\n\n* SURGE:\nProtect against life-threatening surge having possible extensive\nimpacts from Flagler Beach to Jupiter Inlet.\n\nIncreasing impacts in this area include:\n- Large areas of deep inundation with storm surge flooding\naccentuated by battering waves. Structural damage to buildings,\nwith several washing away. Damage compounded by floating\ndebris. Locations may be uninhabitable for an extended period.\n- Large sections of near-shore escape routes and secondary roads\nwashed out or severely flooded. Flood control systems and\nbarriers may become stressed.\n- Severe beach erosion with significant dune loss.\n- Major damage to marinas, docks, boardwalks, and piers. Many\nsmall craft broken away from moorings, especially in\nunprotected anchorages with some lifted onshore and stranded.\n\n\n* WIND:\nProtect against life-threatening wind having possible extensive impacts\nover the coastal counties of Volusia, Brevard, Indian River, Saint\nLucie and Martin.\n\nIncreasing impacts in this area include:\n- Considerable roof damage to sturdy buildings, with some having\nwindow, door, and garage door failures leading to structural\ndamage. Mobile homes severely damaged, with some destroyed.\nDamage accentuated by airborne projectiles. Locations may be\nuninhabitable for weeks.\n- Many large trees snapped or uprooted along with fences and\nroadway signs blown over.\n- Some roads impassable from large debris, and more within urban\nor heavily wooded places. Several bridges, causeways, and\naccess routes impassable.\n- Large areas with power and communications outages.\n\nAlso, protect against dangerous wind having possible limited to\nsignificant impacts across the interior counties of Lake, Seminole,\nOrange, Osceola, and Okeechobee. Move any unsecured objects inside.\n\n* FLOODING RAIN:\nProtect against dangerous rainfall flooding having possible significant\nimpacts across all of east central Florida, but particularly over areas\nnear the coast.\n\nPotential impacts include:\n- Heavy rainfall flooding may prompt several evacuations and\nrescues.\n- Rivers and tributaries may quickly become swollen with swifter\ncurrents and overspill their banks in a few places, especially\nin usually vulnerable spots. Small streams, creeks, canals,\narroyos, and ditches overflow.\n- Flood waters can enter some structures or weaken foundations.\nSeveral places may experience expanded areas of rapid\ninundation at underpasses, low-lying spots, and poor drainage\nareas. Some streets and parking lots take on moving water as\nstorm drains and retention ponds overflow. Driving conditions\nbecome hazardous. Some road and bridge closures.\n\nProtect against locally hazardous rainfall flooding having possible\nlimited impacts across the interior, especially in urban and poorly\ndrained low lying areas.\n\n* TORNADOES:\nProtect against a tornado event having possible limited impacts along\nthe coast. Potential impacts include:\n- The occurrence of isolated tornadoes can hinder the execution\nof emergency plans during tropical events.\n- A few places may experience tornado damage, along with power\nand communications disruptions.\n- Locations could realize roofs peeled off buildings, chimneys\ntoppled, mobile homes pushed off foundations or overturned,\nlarge tree tops and branches snapped off, shallow-rooted trees\nknocked over, moving vehicles blown off roads, and small boats\npulled from moorings.\n\nElsewhere across EAST CENTRAL FLORIDA, little to no impact is\nanticipated.",
        "instruction": "* EVACUATIONS:\n\nListen to local official for recommended preparedness actions,\nincluding possible evacuation. If ordered to evacuate, do so\nimmediately.\n\nIf evacuating, leave with a destination in mind and allow extra time\nto get there. Take your emergency supplies kit. Gas up your vehicle\nahead of time. Follow designated evacuation routes. Seek traffic\ninformation on roadway signs, the radio, and from official sources.\n\nLet others know where you are going prior to departure. Secure loose\nitems and pets in the car, and avoid distracted driving.\n\nFor those not under evacuation orders, assess the risk from wind,\nfalling trees, and flooding at your location. If you decide to move,\nrelocate to a safer location nearby. If you do not relocate, help keep\nroadways open for those under evacuation orders.\n\n\n* OTHER PREPAREDNESS INFORMATION:\n\nPreparations to protect life and property should be completed by now.\nEnsure you are in a safe location before the onset of strong winds or\npossible flooding.\n\nIf you are relocating to safe shelter, leave as early as possible.\nAllow extra time to reach your destination. Many roads and bridges\nwill be closed once strong winds arrive. Check the latest weather\nforecast before departing and drive with caution.\n\nKeep cell phones well charged. Cell phone chargers for automobiles\ncan be helpful, but be aware of your risk for deadly carbon monoxide\npoisoning if your car is left idling in a garage or other poorly\nventilated area.\n\nStorm surge is the leading killer associated with tropical storms and\nhurricanes! Make sure you are in a safe area away from the surge\nzone. Even if you are not in a surge-prone area, you could find\nyourself cutoff by flood waters during and after the storm. Heed\nevacuation orders issued by the local authorities.",

        "description": "This product covers southeast South Carolina and southeast Georgia\n\n**HURRICANE DORIAN EXPECTED TO IMPACT THE AREA WEDNESDAY THROUGH\nTHURSDAY**\n\nNEW INFORMATION\n---------------\n\n* CHANGES TO WATCHES AND WARNINGS:\n- None\n\n* CURRENT WATCHES AND WARNINGS:\n- A Tropical Storm Watch is in effect for Dorchester, Effingham,\nHampton, Inland Colleton, and Long\n- A Storm Surge Watch and Hurricane Watch are in effect for\nBeaufort, Charleston, Coastal Colleton, Coastal Jasper, and\nTidal Berkeley\n- A Storm Surge Warning and Hurricane Watch are in effect for\nCoastal Bryan, Coastal Chatham, Coastal Liberty, Coastal\nMcIntosh, and Inland McIntosh\n- A Hurricane Watch is in effect for Inland Berkeley, Inland\nBryan, Inland Chatham, Inland Jasper, and Inland Liberty\n\n* STORM INFORMATION:\n- About 410 miles south-southeast of Charleston SC or about 390\nmiles south-southeast of Savannah GA\n- 26.9N 78.4W\n- Storm Intensity 120 mph\n- Movement Stationary\n\nSITUATION OVERVIEW\n------------------\n\nDangerous Hurricane Dorian will move offshore of the Florida east\ncoast through Wednesday and offshore of the South Carolina and Georgia\ncoast Wednesday Night through Thursday. The hurricane will bring an\nincreased risk for strong winds, storm surge inundation, flash\nflooding, strong rip currents, and dangerous marine conditions to the\nregion. The combination of significant storm surge inundation and\nheavy rainfall could enhance the risk for flash flooding, especially\nalong the lower South Carolina coast, including Downtown Charleston\nand the nearby coastal communities.\n\nPOTENTIAL IMPACTS\n-----------------\n\n* SURGE:\nPrepare for life-threatening surge having possible extensive impacts\nacross across the coastal counties of Southeast South Carolina and\nSoutheast Georgia.\n- Large areas of deep inundation of saltwater along immediate\nshorelines and in low-lying spots farther inland near rivers\nand creeks, with storm surge flooding accentuated by battering\nwaves. Structural damage to buildings, with several washing\naway. Damage compounded by floating debris. Locations may be\nuninhabitable for an extended period.\n- Large sections of near-shore escape routes and secondary roads\nwashed out or flooded and impassable. Flood control systems and\nbarriers could become stressed.\n- Severe beach erosion with significant dune loss.\n- Major damage to marinas, docks, boardwalks, and piers. Many\nsmall craft broken away from moorings, especially in\nunprotected anchorages, with some lifted onshore and stranded.\n- Drinking water and sewer services negatively impacted.\n- Hazardous containers and materials possibly present in surge\nwaters.\n\nElsewhere across southeast South Carolina and southeast Georgia,\nlittle to no impact is anticipated.\n\n* WIND:\nPrepare for life-threatening wind having possible extensive impacts for\nareas roughly along and east of Interstate 95. Potential impacts in\nthis area include:\n- Considerable roof damage to sturdy buildings, with some window,\ndoor, and garage door failures leading to structural damage.\nMobile homes severely damaged, with some destroyed. Damage\naccentuated by airborne projectiles. Some locations may be\nuninhabitable for weeks.\n- Danger of death or injury from falling objects and airborne\nprojectiles outside.\n- Large trees snapped or uprooted.\n- Some roads impassable from large debris, and more within urban\nor heavily wooded locations. Several bridges and access routes\nimpassable.\n- Large areas with power and communications outages, which could\npersist for days.\n- Several secured small craft could break free from moorings.\n\nAlso, prepare for dangerous wind having possible limited to\nsignificant impacts across interior Southeast South Carolina and\nSoutheast Georgia.\n\n* FLOODING RAIN:\nPrepare for dangerous rainfall flooding having possible significant\nimpacts across coastal areas of Southeast South Carolina and Southeast\nGeorgia. Potential impacts include:\n- Major rainfall flooding could prompt many rescues.\n- Rivers and tributaries could rapidly overflow their banks in\nmultiple locations. Small streams, creeks, canals, ditches may\nbecome dangerous rivers. Flood control systems and barriers\ncould become stressed.\n- Flood waters could enter many structures within multiple\ncommunities; some structures become uninhabitable or are washed\naway. Flood waters could cover multiple escape routes. Streets\nand parking lots become rivers of moving water with underpasses\nsubmerged. Driving conditions become dangerous. Many road and\nbridge closures with some weakened or washed out.\n- Drinking water and sewer services could be negatively impacted.\n- Hazardous containers and materials could possibly be present in\nflood waters.\n\nPrepare for locally hazardous rainfall flooding having possible\nlimited impacts across interior Southeast South Carolina and Southeast\nGeorgia.\n\n* TORNADOES:\nPrepare for a tornado event having possible limited impacts across\nthe coastal areas of Southeast South Carolina and Southeast Georgia.\nPotential impacts include:\n- Isolated tornadoes can hinder the execution of emergency plans.\n- Isolated locations could experience tornado damage, along with\npower and communications disruptions.\n- In isolated locations, tornadoes could damage trees, vehicles,\nboats and buildings, especially mobile homes and other poorly\nconstructed structures.\n\nElsewhere across southeast South Carolina and southeast Georgia,\nlittle to no impact is anticipated.\n\n* OTHER COASTAL HAZARDS:\nSevere beach erosion, high surf with breakers 5 feet or greater, and strong\nrip currents will occur across the beaches of Southeast South Carolina and\nSoutheast Georgia. A High Surf Advisory is in effect.",
        "instruction": "* EVACUATIONS:\nListen to local official for recommended preparedness actions,\nincluding possible evacuation. If ordered to evacuate, do so\nimmediately.\n\nFor those not under evacuation orders, assess the risk from wind,\nfalling trees, and flooding at your location. If you decide to move,\nrelocate to a safer location nearby. If you do not relocate, help keep\nroadways open for those under evacuation orders.\n\nIf evacuating, follow designated evacuation routes. Seek traffic\ninformation on roadway signs, the radio, and from official sources.\n\n* OTHER PREPAREDNESS INFORMATION:\nWhen making safety and preparedness decisions, do not focus on the\nexact forecast track since hazards such as flooding rain, damaging wind\ngusts, storm surge, and tornadoes extend well away from the center of\nthe storm.\n\nIf you live in a place particularly vulnerable to flooding, such as\nnear the ocean or a large inland lake, in a low-lying or poor\ndrainage area, in a valley, or near an already swollen river, plan to\nmove to safe shelter on higher ground.\n\nIf you are a visitor, know the name of the county or parish in which\nyou are located and where it is relative to current watches and\nwarnings. If staying at a hotel, ask the management staff about their\nonsite disaster plan. Listen for evacuation orders, especially\npertaining to area visitors.\n\n* ADDITIONAL SOURCES OF INFORMATION:\n- For information on appropriate preparations see ready.gov\n- For information on creating an emergency plan see getagameplan.org\n- For additional disaster preparedness information see redcross.org",

        "description": "This product covers West Central and Southwest Florida\n\n**DORIAN STILL NEARLY STATIONARY BUT EXPECTED TO BEGIN MOVING\nNORTH-NORTHWESTWARD LATER THIS MORNING**\n\n\nNEW INFORMATION\n---------------\n\n* CHANGES TO WATCHES AND WARNINGS:\n- None\n\n* CURRENT WATCHES AND WARNINGS:\n- A Tropical Storm Watch is in effect for Highlands and Polk\n\n* STORM INFORMATION:\n- About 190 miles southeast of Sebring and 220 miles southeast of\nWinter Haven\n- 26.9N 78.4W\n- Storm Intensity 120 mph\n- Movement Stationary\n\nSITUATION OVERVIEW\n------------------\n\nMajor Hurricane Dorian is forecast to begin to move slowly north\ntoday and track offshore the Florida east coast. At this time the\nprimary concern is for tropical storm force winds over Highlands\nCounty and eastern portions of Polk County.\n\nPOTENTIAL IMPACTS\n-----------------\n\n* WIND:\nPrepare for hazardous wind having possible limited impacts across eastern\nPolk and Highlands counties. Potential impacts in this area include:\n- Damage to porches, awnings, carports, sheds, and unanchored\nmobile homes. Unsecured lightweight objects blown about.\n- Many large tree limbs broken off. A few trees snapped or\nuprooted, but with greater numbers in places where trees are\nshallow rooted. Some fences and roadway signs blown over.\n- A few roads impassable from debris, particularly within urban\nor heavily wooded places. Hazardous driving conditions on\nbridges and other elevated roadways.\n- Scattered power and communications outages.\n\nElsewhere across West Central and Southwest Florida, little to no\nimpact is anticipated.\n\n* FLOODING RAIN:\nPrepare for locally hazardous rainfall flooding having possible\nlimited impacts across eastern Polk and Highlands counties. Potential\nimpacts include:\n- Localized rainfall flooding may prompt a few evacuations.\n- Rivers and tributaries may quickly rise with swifter currents.\nSmall streams, creeks, canals, and ditches may become swollen\nand overflow in spots.\n- Flood waters can enter a few structures, especially in usually\nvulnerable spots. A few places where rapid ponding of water\noccurs at underpasses, low-lying spots, and poor drainage\nareas. Several storm drains and retention ponds become\nnear-full and begin to overflow. Some brief road and bridge\nclosures.\n\nElsewhere across West Central and Southwest Florida, little to no\nimpact is anticipated.",
        "instruction": "* EVACUATIONS:\nFor those not under evacuation orders, assess the risk from wind,\nfalling trees, and flooding at your location. If you decide to\nmove, relocate to a safer location nearby. If you do not relocate,\nhelp keep roadways open for those under evacuation orders.\n\n* OTHER PREPAREDNESS INFORMATION:\nWhen making safety and preparedness decisions, do not focus on the\nexact forecast track since hazards such as flooding rain, damaging\nwind gusts, storm surge, and tornadoes extend well away from the\ncenter of the storm.\n\nIf in a place that is vulnerable to high wind, such as near large\ntrees, a manufactured home, upper floors of a high-rise building, or\non a boat, plan to move to safe shelter.\n\nIf you live in a place particularly vulnerable to flooding, such as\nnear the ocean or a large inland lake, in a low-lying or poor\ndrainage area, or near an already swollen river, plan to move to safe\nshelter on higher ground.\n\nAlways heed the advice of local officials and comply with orders that\nare issued. Do not needlessly jeopardize your life or the lives of\nothers.\n\nIf you are a visitor, know the name of the county or parish in which\nyou are located and where it is relative to current watches and\nwarnings. If staying at a hotel, ask the management staff about their\nonsite disaster plan. Listen for evacuation orders, especially\npertaining to area visitors.\n\nClosely monitor weather.gov, NOAA Weather Radio and local news\noutlets for official storm information. Listen for possible changes\nto the forecast.\n\n* ADDITIONAL SOURCES OF INFORMATION:\n- For information on appropriate preparations see ready.gov\n- For information on creating an emergency plan see getagameplan.org\n- For additional disaster preparedness information see redcross.org",

        "description": "This product covers SOUTH FLORIDA\n\n**TROPICAL STORM FORCE WIND GUSTS CONTINUING ACROSS SOUTHEAST FLORIDA**\n\n\nNEW INFORMATION\n---------------\n\n* CHANGES TO WATCHES AND WARNINGS:\n- None\n\n* CURRENT WATCHES AND WARNINGS:\n- A Tropical Storm Warning and Hurricane Watch are in effect for\nMetro Palm Beach\n- A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for Inland Palm Beach\n- A Storm Surge Warning, Tropical Storm Warning, and Hurricane\nWatch are in effect for Coastal Palm Beach\n- A Tropical Storm Watch is in effect for Coastal Broward,\nGlades, and Metro Broward\n\n* STORM INFORMATION:\n- About 140 miles northeast of Miami FL or about 220 miles\neast-northeast of Naples FL\n- 26.9N 78.4W\n- Storm Intensity 120 mph\n- Movement Stationary\n\nSITUATION OVERVIEW\n------------------\n\nThere are no major changes to the previous forecast. The center of\nHurricane Dorian remains nearly stationary just to the north of Grand\nBahama this morning. While the center of Dorian is still forecast to\nremain offshore, periods of tropical storm force winds with higher\ngusts are expected over Palm Beach County through tonight, with the\ngreatest chances over the northeastern portion of the county.\nOccasional tropical storm force wind gusts from squalls are possible\nover the rest of South Florida through this evening.\n\nThe threat of life-threatening storm surge exists along the Palm Beach\nCounty coast over the next couple of days, where a storm surge of 3 to\n5 feet above ground level is expected along surge-prone locations\nnorth of Lantana. South of Lantana to Boca Raton, a storm surge of\n2 to 4 feet above ground level is possible. This surge includes the\neffects from some of the wave action from extremely high waves over\nthe offshore Atlantic waters. Coastal Broward County could experience\nstorm surge of 1 to 3 feet above ground level, while coastal\nMiami-Dade County could experience a storm surge of 2 feet or less\nabove ground level.\n\nDue to Dorian's close proximity to the Florida east coast, small\nshifts in the track of the hurricane could still bring changes in\nexpected impacts. Residents and visitors in South Florida should\ncontinue to monitor the progress of Hurricane Dorian and follow the\nadvice of local officials.\n\nRegardless of the eventual track of Dorian, major marine and beach\nimpacts are expected along the entire Southeast Florida coast. A\nprolonged period of strong winds over the Atlantic coastal waters will\ncause very hazardous seas, rough surf, and beach erosion through the\nnext several days.\n\nA few tornadoes are also possible over the next day or so, with the\ngreatest potential along and near the east coast.\n\nPOTENTIAL IMPACTS\n-----------------\n\n* WIND:\nPotential impacts from the main wind event are now unfolding across\nnortheastern and coastal Palm Beach County. Present indications are\nthat sustained winds of 30 to 45 mph with gusts between 50 and 60 mph\nare expected today. These winds are expected to be common from 8 AM to\n6 PM EDT today, with the most-likely time for strongest winds from noon\nto 4 PM EDT. Remain well sheltered from life-threatening wind having\npossible extensive impacts. If realized, these impacts include:\n- Many large trees snapped or uprooted along with fences and\nroadway signs blown over.\n- Some roads impassable from large debris, and more within urban\nor heavily wooded places. Several bridges, causeways, and\naccess routes impassable.\n- Large areas with power and communications outages.\n\nPotential impacts from the main wind event are also now unfolding\nacross the rest of South Florida. Remain well sheltered from\ndangerous wind having possible limited to significant impacts.\n\n* SURGE:\nPotential impacts from the main surge event are now unfolding across\nthe Atlantic coast of Southeast Florida. Remain well away from life-\nthreatening surge having possible significant impacts. If realized,\nthese impacts include:\n- Areas of inundation with storm surge flooding accentuated by\nwaves. Damage to several buildings, mainly near the coast.\n- Sections of near-shore escape routes and secondary roads become\nweakened or washed out, especially in usually vulnerable low\nspots.\n- Major beach erosion with heavy surf breaching dunes. Strong and\nnumerous rip currents.\n- Moderate damage to marinas, docks, boardwalks, and piers.\nSeveral small craft broken away from moorings, especially in\nunprotected anchorages.\n\n* FLOODING RAIN:\nPotential impacts from the flooding rain are still unfolding across\nSouth Florida. Remain well guarded against locally hazardous flood\nwaters having possible limited impacts. If realized, these impacts\ninclude:\n- Flood waters can enter a few structures, especially in usually\nvulnerable spots. A few places where rapid ponding of water\noccurs at underpasses, low-lying spots, and poor drainage\nareas. Several storm drains and retention ponds become\nnear-full and begin to overflow. Some brief road and bridge\nclosures.\n\n* TORNADOES:\nPotential impacts from tornadoes are still unfolding across Southeast\nFlorida. Remain well braced against a tornado event having possible\nlimited impacts. If realized, these impacts include:\n- The occurrence of isolated tornadoes can hinder the execution\nof emergency plans during tropical events.\n- A few places may experience tornado damage, along with power\nand communications disruptions.\n- Locations could realize roofs peeled off buildings, mobile\nhomes pushed off foundations or overturned, large tree tops and\nbranches snapped off, shallow-rooted trees knocked over, moving\nvehicles blown off roads, and small boats pulled from moorings.\n\nElsewhere across South Florida, little to no impact is anticipated.",

Prepare for considerable wind\ndamage.\n- ACT: Move to safe shelter before the wind becomes hazardous.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Extensive\n- Considerable roof damage to sturdy buildings, with some\nwindow, door, and garage door failures leading to\nstructural damage. Mobile homes severely damaged, with some\ndestroyed. Damage accentuated by airborne projectiles. Some\nlocations may be uninhabitable for weeks.\n- Danger of death or injury from falling objects and airborne\nprojectiles outside.\n- Large trees snapped or uprooted.\n- Some roads impassable from large debris, and more within\nurban or heavily wooded locations. Several bridges and\naccess routes impassable.\n- Large areas with power and communications outages, which\ncould persist for days.\n- Several secured small craft could break free from moorings.\n\n* STORM SURGE\n- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST: Life-threatening storm surge possible\n- Peak Storm Surge Inundation: The potential for 4-7 feet\nabove ground somewhere within surge prone areas\n- Window of concern: Begins early this morning\n\n- POTENTIAL THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY: Potential for storm\nsurge flooding greater than 6 feet above ground\n- The storm surge threat has remained nearly steady from the\nprevious assessment.\n- PLAN: Plan for life-threatening storm surge flooding of\ngreater than 6 feet above ground.\n- PREPARE: Evacuation preparations should be underway.\nAssemble disaster supplies and know your evacuation route.\n- ACT: Leave if evacuation orders are given for your area.\nFailure to heed evacuation orders may result in the loss of\nyour life.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Extensive\n- Large areas of deep inundation of saltwater along immediate\nshorelines and in low-lying spots farther inland near\nrivers and creeks, with storm surge flooding accentuated by\nbattering waves. Structural damage to buildings, with\nseveral washing away. Damage compounded by floating debris.\nLocations may be uninhabitable for an extended period.\n- Large sections of near-shore escape routes and secondary\nroads washed out or flooded and impassable. Flood control\nsystems and barriers could become stressed.\n- Severe beach erosion with significant dune loss.\n- Major damage to marinas, docks, boardwalks, and piers. Many\nsmall craft broken away from moorings, especially in\nunprotected anchorages, with some lifted onshore and\nstranded.\n- Drinking water and sewer services negatively impacted.\n- Hazardous containers and materials possibly present in\nsurge waters.\n\n* FLOODING RAIN\n- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST:\n- Peak Rainfall Amounts: Additional 4-8 inches, with locally\nhigher amounts\n\n- POTENTIAL THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY: Potential for moderate\nflooding rain\n- The flooding rain threat has remained nearly steady from\nthe previous assessment.\n- PLAN: Emergency plans should include the potential for\nmoderate flooding from heavy rain. Evacuations and rescues\nare possible.\n- PREPARE: Consider protective actions if you are in an area\nvulnerable to flooding.\n- ACT: Heed any flood watches and warnings. Failure to take\naction may result in serious injury or loss of life.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Significant\n- Moderate rainfall flooding could prompt some rescues.\n- Rivers and tributaries could quickly become swollen with\nswifter currents and overspill their banks in a few places,\nespecially in normally vulnerable spots. Small streams,\ncreeks, canals, and ditches overflow.\n- Flood waters can enter some structures or weaken\nfoundations. Several places could experience expanded areas\nof rapid inundation at underpasses, low-lying spots, and\npoor drainage areas. Some streets and parking lots take on\nmoving water as storm drains and retention ponds overflow.\nDriving conditions become hazardous.

Prepare for\nsignificant wind damage.\n- ACT: Move to safe shelter before the wind becomes hazardous.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Significant\n- Some damage to roofing and siding materials, along with\ndamage to porches, awnings, carports, and sheds. A few\nbuildings experiencing window, door, and garage door\nfailures. Mobile homes damaged, especially if unanchored.\nUnsecured lightweight objects become dangerous projectiles.\n- Several large trees snapped or uprooted, but with greater\nnumbers in places where trees are shallow rooted.\n- Some roads impassable from large debris, and more within\nurban or heavily wooded places. A few bridges and access\nroutes impassable.\n- Travel by vehicle or on foot increasingly difficult. Danger\nof death or injury from falling objects such as trees or\nelectric wires outside.\n- Scattered power and communications outages, but more\nprevalent in areas with above ground lines, which could\npersist for hours or days.\n- Some poorly secured small craft could break loose from\ntheir moorings.\n\n* STORM SURGE\n- No storm surge inundation forecast\n\n- POTENTIAL THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY: Little to no storm surge\nflooding\n- The storm surge threat has remained nearly steady from the\nprevious assessment.\n- PLAN: There is little to no threat of storm surge flooding.\nRough surf, coastal erosion, and life-threatening rip\ncurrents are possible.\n- PREPARE: Little to no preparations for storm surge flooding\nare needed.\n- ACT: Follow the instructions of local officials.

Prepare for\nsignificant wind damage.\n- ACT: Move to safe shelter before the wind becomes hazardous.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Significant\n- Some damage to roofing and siding materials, along with\ndamage to porches, awnings, carports, and sheds. A few\nbuildings experiencing window, door, and garage door\nfailures. Mobile homes damaged, especially if unanchored.\nUnsecured lightweight objects become dangerous projectiles.\n- Several large trees snapped or uprooted, but with greater\nnumbers in places where trees are shallow rooted.\n- Some roads impassable from large debris, and more within\nurban or heavily wooded places. A few bridges and access\nroutes impassable.\n- Travel by vehicle or on foot increasingly difficult. Danger\nof death or injury from falling objects such as trees or\nelectric wires outside.\n- Scattered power and communications outages, but more\nprevalent in areas with above ground lines, which could\npersist for hours or days.\n- Some poorly secured small craft could break loose from\ntheir moorings.\n\n* STORM SURGE\n- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST: Life-threatening storm surge possible\n- Peak Storm Surge Inundation: The potential for 4-7 feet\nabove ground somewhere within surge prone areas\n- Window of concern: Begins early this morning\n\n- POTENTIAL THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY: Potential for storm\nsurge flooding greater than 6 feet above ground\n- The storm surge threat has remained nearly steady from the\nprevious assessment.\n- PLAN: Plan for life-threatening storm surge flooding of\ngreater than 6 feet above ground.\n- PREPARE: Evacuation preparations should be underway.\nAssemble disaster supplies and know your evacuation route.\n- ACT: Leave if evacuation orders are given for your area.\nFailure to heed evacuation orders may result in the loss of\nyour life.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Extensive\n- Large areas of deep inundation of saltwater along immediate\nshorelines and in low-lying spots farther inland near\nrivers and creeks, with storm surge flooding accentuated by\nbattering waves. Structural damage to buildings, with\nseveral washing away. Damage compounded by floating debris.\nLocations may be uninhabitable for an extended period.\n- Large sections of near-shore escape routes and secondary\nroads washed out or flooded and impassable. Flood control\nsystems and barriers could become stressed.\n- Severe beach erosion with significant dune loss.\n- Major damage to marinas, docks, boardwalks, and piers. Many\nsmall craft broken away from moorings, especially in\nunprotected anchorages, with some lifted onshore and\nstranded.\n- Drinking water and sewer services negatively impacted.\n- Hazardous containers and materials possibly present in\nsurge waters.\n\n* FLOODING RAIN\n- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST:\n- Peak Rainfall Amounts: Additional 2-4 inches, with locally\nhigher amounts\n\n- POTENTIAL THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY: Potential for moderate\nflooding rain\n- The flooding rain threat has remained nearly steady from\nthe previous assessment.\n- PLAN: Emergency plans should include the potential for\nmoderate flooding from heavy rain. Evacuations and rescues\nare possible.\n- PREPARE: Consider protective actions if you are in an area\nvulnerable to flooding.\n- ACT: Heed any flood watches and warnings. Failure to take\naction may result in serious injury or loss of life.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Significant\n- Moderate rainfall flooding could prompt some rescues.\n- Rivers and tributaries could quickly become swollen with\nswifter currents and overspill their banks in a few places,\nespecially in normally vulnerable spots. Small streams,\ncreeks, canals, and ditches overflow.\n- Flood waters can enter some structures or weaken\nfoundations. Several places could experience expanded areas\nof rapid inundation at underpasses, low-lying spots, and\npoor drainage areas. Some streets and parking lots take on\nmoving water as storm drains and retention ponds overflow.\nDriving conditions become hazardous. Some road and bridge\nclosures.\n\n* TORNADO\n- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST:\n- Situation is somewhat favorable for tornadoes\n\n- POTENTIAL THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY: Potential for a few\ntornadoes\n- The tornado threat has increased from the previous\nassessment.\n- PLAN: Emergency plans should include the potential for a\nfew tornadoes.\n- PREPARE: If your shelter is particularly vulnerable to\ntornadoes, prepare to relocate to safe shelter before\nhazardous weather arrives.\n- ACT: If a tornado warning is issued, be ready to shelter\nquickly.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Limited\n- Isolated tornadoes can hinder the execution of emergency\nplans.\n- Isolated locations could experience tornado damage, along\nwith power and communications disruptions.\n- In isolated locations, tornadoes could damage trees,\nvehicles, boats and buildings, especially mobile homes and\nother poorly constructed structures.\n\n* FOR MORE INFORMATION:\n- https://weather.gov/chs\n- https://ready.gov/hurricanes",

Prepare for considerable wind\ndamage.\n- ACT: Move to safe shelter before the wind becomes hazardous.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Extensive\n- Considerable roof damage to sturdy buildings, with some\nwindow, door, and garage door failures leading to\nstructural damage. Mobile homes severely damaged, with some\ndestroyed. Damage accentuated by airborne projectiles. Some\nlocations may be uninhabitable for weeks.\n- Danger of death or injury from falling objects and airborne\nprojectiles outside.\n- Large trees snapped or uprooted.\n- Some roads impassable from large debris, and more within\nurban or heavily wooded locations. Several bridges and\naccess routes impassable.\n- Large areas with power and communications outages, which\ncould persist for days.\n- Several secured small craft could break free from moorings.\n\n* STORM SURGE\n- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST: Life-threatening storm surge possible\n- Peak Storm Surge Inundation: The potential for 4-7 feet\nabove ground somewhere within surge prone areas\n- Window of concern: Begins early this morning\n\n- POTENTIAL THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY: Potential for storm\nsurge flooding greater than 6 feet above ground\n- The storm surge threat has remained nearly steady from the\nprevious assessment.\n- PLAN: Plan for life-threatening storm surge flooding of\ngreater than 6 feet above ground.\n- PREPARE: Evacuation preparations should be underway.\nAssemble disaster supplies and know your evacuation route.\n- ACT: Leave if evacuation orders are given for your area.\nFailure to heed evacuation orders may result in the loss of\nyour life.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Extensive\n- Large areas of deep inundation of saltwater along immediate\nshorelines and in low-lying spots farther inland near\nrivers and creeks, with storm surge flooding accentuated by\nbattering waves. Structural damage to buildings, with\nseveral washing away. Damage compounded by floating debris.\nLocations may be uninhabitable for an extended period.\n- Large sections of near-shore escape routes and secondary\nroads washed out or flooded and impassable. Flood control\nsystems and barriers could become stressed.\n- Severe beach erosion with significant dune loss.\n- Major damage to marinas, docks, boardwalks, and piers. Many\nsmall craft broken away from moorings, especially in\nunprotected anchorages, with some lifted onshore and\nstranded.\n- Drinking water and sewer services negatively impacted.\n- Hazardous containers and materials possibly present in\nsurge waters.\n\n* FLOODING RAIN\n- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST:\n- Peak Rainfall Amounts: Additional 4-8 inches, with locally\nhigher amounts\n\n- POTENTIAL THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY: Potential for moderate\nflooding rain\n- The flooding rain threat has remained nearly steady from\nthe previous assessment.\n- PLAN: Emergency plans should include the potential for\nmoderate flooding from heavy rain. Evacuations and rescues\nare possible.\n- PREPARE: Consider protective actions if you are in an area\nvulnerable to flooding.\n- ACT: Heed any flood watches and warnings. Failure to take\naction may result in serious injury or loss of life.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Significant\n- Moderate rainfall flooding could prompt some rescues.\n- Rivers and tributaries could quickly become swollen with\nswifter currents and overspill their banks in a few places,\nespecially in normally vulnerable spots. Small streams,\ncreeks, canals, and ditches overflow.\n- Flood waters can enter some structures or weaken\nfoundations. Several places could experience expanded areas\nof rapid inundation at underpasses, low-lying spots, and\npoor drainage areas. Some streets and parking lots take on\nmoving water as storm drains and retention ponds overflow.\nDriving conditions become hazardous. Some road and bridge\nclosures.\n\n* TORNADO\n- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST:\n- Situation is somewhat favorable for tornadoes\n\n- POTENTIAL THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY: Potential for a few\ntornadoes\n- The tornado threat has increased from the previous\nassessment.\n- PLAN: Emergency plans should include the potential for a\nfew tornadoes.\n- PREPARE: If your shelter is particularly vulnerable to\ntornadoes, prepare to relocate to safe shelter before\nhazardous weather arrives.\n- ACT: If a tornado warning is issued, be ready to shelter\nquickly.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Limited\n- Isolated tornadoes can hinder the execution of emergency\nplans.\n- Isolated locations could experience tornado damage, along\nwith power and communications disruptions.\n- In isolated locations, tornadoes could damage trees,\nvehicles, boats and buildings, especially mobile homes and\nother poorly constructed structures.\n\n* FOR MORE INFORMATION:\n- https://weather.gov/chs\n- https://ready.gov/hurricanes\n- https://www.chathamcountyga.gov",

Prepare for\nsignificant wind damage.\n- ACT: Move to safe shelter before the wind becomes hazardous.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Significant\n- Some damage to roofing and siding materials, along with\ndamage to porches, awnings, carports, and sheds. A few\nbuildings experiencing window, door, and garage door\nfailures. Mobile homes damaged, especially if unanchored.\nUnsecured lightweight objects become dangerous projectiles.\n- Several large trees snapped or uprooted, but with greater\nnumbers in places where trees are shallow rooted.\n- Some roads impassable from large debris, and more within\nurban or heavily wooded places. A few bridges and access\nroutes impassable.\n- Travel by vehicle or on foot increasingly difficult. Danger\nof death or injury from falling objects such as trees or\nelectric wires outside.\n- Scattered power and communications outages, but more\nprevalent in areas with above ground lines, which could\npersist for hours or days.\n- Some poorly secured small craft could break loose from\ntheir moorings.\n\n* STORM SURGE\n- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST: Life-threatening storm surge possible\n- Peak Storm Surge Inundation: The potential for 4-7 feet\nabove ground somewhere within surge prone areas\n- Window of concern: Begins early this morning\n\n- POTENTIAL THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY: Potential for storm\nsurge flooding greater than 6 feet above ground\n- The storm surge threat has remained nearly steady from the\nprevious assessment.\n- PLAN: Plan for life-threatening storm surge flooding of\ngreater than 6 feet above ground.\n- PREPARE: Evacuation preparations should be underway.\nAssemble disaster supplies and know your evacuation route.\n- ACT: Leave if evacuation orders are given for your area.\nFailure to heed evacuation orders may result in the loss of\nyour life.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Extensive\n- Large areas of deep inundation of saltwater along immediate\nshorelines and in low-lying spots farther inland near\nrivers and creeks, with storm surge flooding accentuated by\nbattering waves. Structural damage to buildings, with\nseveral washing away. Damage compounded by floating debris.\nLocations may be uninhabitable for an extended period.\n- Large sections of near-shore escape routes and secondary\nroads washed out or flooded and impassable. Flood control\nsystems and barriers could become stressed.\n- Severe beach erosion with significant dune loss.\n- Major damage to marinas, docks, boardwalks, and piers. Many\nsmall craft broken away from moorings, especially in\nunprotected anchorages, with some lifted onshore and\nstranded.\n- Drinking water and sewer services negatively impacted.\n- Hazardous containers and materials possibly present in\nsurge waters.\n\n* FLOODING RAIN\n- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST:\n- Peak Rainfall Amounts: Additional 2-4 inches, with locally\nhigher amounts\n\n- POTENTIAL THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY: Potential for moderate\nflooding rain\n- The flooding rain threat has remained nearly steady from\nthe previous assessment.\n- PLAN: Emergency plans should include the potential for\nmoderate flooding from heavy rain. Evacuations and rescues\nare possible.\n- PREPARE: Consider protective actions if you are in an area\nvulnerable to flooding.\n- ACT: Heed any flood watches and warnings. Failure to take\naction may result in serious injury or loss of life.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Significant\n- Moderate rainfall flooding could prompt some rescues.\n- Rivers and tributaries could quickly become swollen with\nswifter currents and overspill their banks in a few places,\nespecially in normally vulnerable spots. Small streams,\ncreeks, canals, and ditches overflow.\n- Flood waters can enter some structures or weaken\nfoundations. Several places could experience expanded areas\nof rapid inundation at underpasses, low-lying spots, and\npoor drainage areas. Some streets and parking lots take on\nmoving water as storm drains and retention ponds overflow.\nDriving conditions become hazardous. Some road and bridge\nclosures.\n\n* TORNADO\n- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST:\n- Situation is somewhat favorable for tornadoes\n\n- POTENTIAL THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY: Potential for a few\ntornadoes\n- The tornado threat has increased from the previous\nassessment.\n- PLAN: Emergency plans should include the potential for a\nfew tornadoes.\n- PREPARE: If your shelter is particularly vulnerable to\ntornadoes, prepare to relocate to safe shelter before\nhazardous weather arrives.\n- ACT: If a tornado warning is issued, be ready to shelter\nquickly.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Limited\n- Isolated tornadoes can hinder the execution of emergency\nplans.\n- Isolated locations could experience tornado damage, along\nwith power and communications disruptions.\n- In isolated locations, tornadoes could damage trees,\nvehicles, boats and buildings, especially mobile homes and\nother poorly constructed structures.\n\n* FOR MORE INFORMATION:\n- https://weather.gov/chs\n- https://ready.gov/hurricanes",

Prepare for considerable wind\ndamage.\n- ACT: Move to safe shelter before the wind becomes hazardous.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Extensive\n- Considerable roof damage to sturdy buildings, with some\nwindow, door, and garage door failures leading to\nstructural damage. Mobile homes severely damaged, with some\ndestroyed. Damage accentuated by airborne projectiles. Some\nlocations may be uninhabitable for weeks.\n- Danger of death or injury from falling objects and airborne\nprojectiles outside.\n- Large trees snapped or uprooted.\n- Some roads impassable from large debris, and more within\nurban or heavily wooded locations. Several bridges and\naccess routes impassable.\n- Large areas with power and communications outages, which\ncould persist for days.\n- Several secured small craft could break free from moorings.\n\n* STORM SURGE\n- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST: Life-threatening storm surge possible\n- Peak Storm Surge Inundation: The potential for 4-7 feet\nabove ground somewhere within surge prone areas\n- Window of concern: Begins early this morning\n\n- POTENTIAL THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY: Potential for storm\nsurge flooding greater than 6 feet above ground\n- The storm surge threat has remained nearly steady from the\nprevious assessment.\n- PLAN: Plan for life-threatening storm surge flooding of\ngreater than 6 feet above ground.\n- PREPARE: Evacuation preparations should be underway.\nAssemble disaster supplies and know your evacuation route.\n- ACT: Leave if evacuation orders are given for your area.\nFailure to heed evacuation orders may result in the loss of\nyour life.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Extensive\n- Large areas of deep inundation of saltwater along immediate\nshorelines and in low-lying spots farther inland near\nrivers and creeks, with storm surge flooding accentuated by\nbattering waves. Structural damage to buildings, with\nseveral washing away. Damage compounded by floating debris.\nLocations may be uninhabitable for an extended period.\n- Large sections of near-shore escape routes and secondary\nroads washed out or flooded and impassable. Flood control\nsystems and barriers could become stressed.\n- Severe beach erosion with significant dune loss.\n- Major damage to marinas, docks, boardwalks, and piers. Many\nsmall craft broken away from moorings, especially in\nunprotected anchorages, with some lifted onshore and\nstranded.\n- Drinking water and sewer services negatively impacted.\n- Hazardous containers and materials possibly present in\nsurge waters.\n\n* FLOODING RAIN\n- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST:\n- Peak Rainfall Amounts: Additional 3-6 inches, with locally\nhigher amounts\n\n- POTENTIAL THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY: Potential for moderate\nflooding rain\n- The flooding rain threat has remained nearly steady from\nthe previous assessment.\n- PLAN: Emergency plans should include the potential for\nmoderate flooding from heavy rain. Evacuations and rescues\nare possible.\n- PREPARE: Consider protective actions if you are in an area\nvulnerable to flooding.\n- ACT: Heed any flood watches and warnings. Failure to take\naction may result in serious injury or loss of life.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Significant\n- Moderate rainfall flooding could prompt some rescues.\n- Rivers and tributaries could quickly become swollen with\nswifter currents and overspill their banks in a few places,\nespecially in normally vulnerable spots. Small streams,\ncreeks, canals, and ditches overflow.\n- Flood waters can enter some structures or weaken\nfoundations. Several places could experience expanded areas\nof rapid inundation at underpasses, low-lying spots, and\npoor drainage areas. Some streets and parking lots take on\nmoving water as storm drains and retention ponds overflow.\nDriving conditions become hazardous. Some road and bridge\nclosures.\n\n* TORNADO\n- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST:\n- Situation is somewhat favorable for tornadoes\n\n- POTENTIAL THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY: Potential for a few\ntornadoes\n- The tornado threat has increased from the previous\nassessment.\n- PLAN: Emergency plans should include the potential for a\nfew tornadoes.\n- PREPARE: If your shelter is particularly vulnerable to\ntornadoes, prepare to relocate to safe shelter before\nhazardous weather arrives.\n- ACT: If a tornado warning is issued, be ready to shelter\nquickly.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Limited\n- Isolated tornadoes can hinder the execution of emergency\nplans.\n- Isolated locations could experience tornado damage, along\nwith power and communications disruptions.\n- In isolated locations, tornadoes could damage trees,\nvehicles, boats and buildings, especially mobile homes and\nother poorly constructed structures.\n\n* FOR MORE INFORMATION:\n- https://weather.gov/chs\n- https://ready.gov/hurricanes",

Prepare for considerable wind\ndamage.\n- ACT: Move to safe shelter before the wind becomes hazardous.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Extensive\n- Considerable roof damage to sturdy buildings, with some\nwindow, door, and garage door failures leading to\nstructural damage. Mobile homes severely damaged, with some\ndestroyed. Damage accentuated by airborne projectiles. Some\nlocations may be uninhabitable for weeks.\n- Danger of death or injury from falling objects and airborne\nprojectiles outside.\n- Large trees snapped or uprooted.\n- Some roads impassable from large debris, and more within\nurban or heavily wooded locations. Several bridges and\naccess routes impassable.\n- Large areas with power and communications outages, which\ncould persist for days.\n- Several secured small craft could break free from moorings.\n\n* STORM SURGE\n- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST: Life-threatening storm surge possible\n- Peak Storm Surge Inundation: The potential for 4-7 feet\nabove ground somewhere within surge prone areas\n- Window of concern: Begins Wednesday morning\n\n- POTENTIAL THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY: Potential for storm\nsurge flooding greater than 6 feet above ground\n- The storm surge threat has remained nearly steady from the\nprevious assessment.\n- PLAN: Plan for life-threatening storm surge flooding of\ngreater than 6 feet above ground.\n- PREPARE: Evacuation efforts should soon be brought to\ncompletion before driving conditions become unsafe.\n- ACT: Leave immediately if evacuation orders are given for\nyour area to avoid being cut off from emergency services or\nneedlessly risk lives.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Extensive\n- Large areas of deep inundation of saltwater along immediate\nshorelines and in low-lying spots farther inland near\nrivers and creeks, with storm surge flooding accentuated by\nbattering waves. Structural damage to buildings, with\nseveral washing away. Damage compounded by floating debris.\nLocations may be uninhabitable for an extended period.\n- Large sections of near-shore escape routes and secondary\nroads washed out or flooded and impassable. Flood control\nsystems and barriers could become stressed.\n- Severe beach erosion with significant dune loss.\n- Major damage to marinas, docks, boardwalks, and piers. Many\nsmall craft broken away from moorings, especially in\nunprotected anchorages, with some lifted onshore and\nstranded.\n- Drinking water and sewer services negatively impacted.\n- Hazardous containers and materials possibly present in\nsurge waters.\n\n* FLOODING RAIN\n- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST:\n- Peak Rainfall Amounts: 4-8 inches, with locally higher\namounts\n\n- POTENTIAL THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY: Potential for moderate\nflooding rain\n- The flooding rain threat has remained nearly steady from\nthe previous assessment.\n- PLAN: Emergency plans should include the potential for\nmoderate flooding from heavy rain. Evacuations and rescues\nare possible.\n- PREPARE: Consider protective actions if you are in an area\nvulnerable to flooding.\n- ACT: Heed any flood watches and warnings. Failure to take\naction may result in serious injury or loss of life.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Significant\n- Moderate rainfall flooding could prompt some rescues.\n- Rivers and tributaries could quickly become swollen with\nswifter currents and overspill their banks in a few places,\nespecially in normally vulnerable spots. Small streams,\ncreeks, canals, and ditches overflow.\n- Flood waters can enter some structures or weaken\nfoundations. Several places could experience expanded areas\nof rapid inundation at underpasses, low-lying spots, and\npoor drainage areas. Some streets and parking lots take on\nmoving water as storm drains and retention ponds overflow.\nDriving conditions become hazardous. Some road and bridge\nclosures.\n\n* TORNADO\n- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST:\n- Situation is somewhat favorable for tornadoes\n\n- POTENTIAL THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY: Potential for a few\ntornadoes\n- The tornado threat has increased from the previous\nassessment.\n- PLAN: Emergency plans should include the potential for a\nfew tornadoes.\n- PREPARE: If your shelter is particularly vulnerable to\ntornadoes, prepare to relocate to safe shelter before\nhazardous weather arrives.\n- ACT: If a tornado warning is issued, be ready to shelter\nquickly.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Limited\n- Isolated tornadoes can hinder the execution of emergency\nplans.\n- Isolated locations could experience tornado damage, along\nwith power and communications disruptions.\n- In isolated locations, tornadoes could damage trees,\nvehicles, boats and buildings, especially mobile homes and\nother poorly constructed structures.\n\n* FOR MORE INFORMATION:\n- https://weather.gov/chs\n- https://ready.gov/hurricanes",

Prepare for\nsignificant wind damage.\n- ACT: Move to safe shelter before the wind becomes hazardous.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Significant\n- Some damage to roofing and siding materials, along with\ndamage to porches, awnings, carports, and sheds. A few\nbuildings experiencing window, door, and garage door\nfailures. Mobile homes damaged, especially if unanchored.\nUnsecured lightweight objects become dangerous projectiles.\n- Several large trees snapped or uprooted, but with greater\nnumbers in places where trees are shallow rooted.\n- Some roads impassable from large debris, and more within\nurban or heavily wooded places. A few bridges and access\nroutes impassable.\n- Travel by vehicle or on foot increasingly difficult. Danger\nof death or injury from falling objects such as trees or\nelectric wires outside.\n- Scattered power and communications outages, but more\nprevalent in areas with above ground lines, which could\npersist for hours or days.\n- Some poorly secured small craft could break loose from\ntheir moorings.\n\n* STORM SURGE\n- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST: Life-threatening storm surge possible\n- Peak Storm Surge Inundation: The potential for 4-7 feet\nabove ground somewhere within surge prone areas\n- Window of concern: Begins early this morning\n\n- POTENTIAL THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY: Potential for storm\nsurge flooding greater than 6 feet above ground\n- The storm surge threat has remained nearly steady from the\nprevious assessment.\n- PLAN: Plan for life-threatening storm surge flooding of\ngreater than 6 feet above ground.\n- PREPARE: Evacuation preparations should be underway.\nAssemble disaster supplies and know your evacuation route.\n- ACT: Leave if evacuation orders are given for your area.\nFailure to heed evacuation orders may result in the loss of\nyour life.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Extensive\n- Large areas of deep inundation of saltwater along immediate\nshorelines and in low-lying spots farther inland near\nrivers and creeks, with storm surge flooding accentuated by\nbattering waves. Structural damage to buildings, with\nseveral washing away. Damage compounded by floating debris.\nLocations may be uninhabitable for an extended period.\n- Large sections of near-shore escape routes and secondary\nroads washed out or flooded and impassable. Flood control\nsystems and barriers could become stressed.\n- Severe beach erosion with significant dune loss.\n- Major damage to marinas, docks, boardwalks, and piers. Many\nsmall craft broken away from moorings, especially in\nunprotected anchorages, with some lifted onshore and\nstranded.\n- Drinking water and sewer services negatively impacted.\n- Hazardous containers and materials possibly present in\nsurge waters.\n\n* FLOODING RAIN\n- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST:\n- Peak Rainfall Amounts: Additional 3-6 inches, with locally\nhigher amounts\n\n- POTENTIAL THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY: Potential for moderate\nflooding rain\n- The flooding rain threat has remained nearly steady from\nthe previous assessment.\n- PLAN: Emergency plans should include the potential for\nmoderate flooding from heavy rain. Evacuations and rescues\nare possible.\n- PREPARE: Consider protective actions if you are in an area\nvulnerable to flooding.\n- ACT: Heed any flood watches and warnings. Failure to take\naction may result in serious injury or loss of life.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Significant\n- Moderate rainfall flooding could prompt some rescues.\n- Rivers and tributaries could quickly become swollen with\nswifter currents and overspill their banks in a few places,\nespecially in normally vulnerable spots. Small streams,\ncreeks, canals, and ditches overflow.\n- Flood waters can enter some structures or weaken\nfoundations. Several places could experience expanded areas\nof rapid inundation at underpasses, low-lying spots, and\npoor drainage areas. Some streets and parking lots take on\nmoving water as storm drains and retention ponds overflow.\nDriving conditions become hazardous. Some road and bridge\nclosures.\n\n* TORNADO\n- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST:\n- Situation is somewhat favorable for tornadoes\n\n- POTENTIAL THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY: Potential for a few\ntornadoes\n- The tornado threat has increased from the previous\nassessment.\n- PLAN: Emergency plans should include the potential for a\nfew tornadoes.\n- PREPARE: If your shelter is particularly vulnerable to\ntornadoes, prepare to relocate to safe shelter before\nhazardous weather arrives.\n- ACT: If a tornado warning is issued, be ready to shelter\nquickly.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Limited\n- Isolated tornadoes can hinder the execution of emergency\nplans.\n- Isolated locations could experience tornado damage, along\nwith power and communications disruptions.\n- In isolated locations, tornadoes could damage trees,\nvehicles, boats and buildings, especially mobile homes and\nother poorly constructed structures.\n\n* FOR MORE INFORMATION:\n- https://weather.gov/chs\n- https://ready.gov/hurricanes",

        "description": "* LOCATIONS AFFECTED\n- Fort McAllister\n\n* WIND\n- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST: Equivalent Tropical Storm force wind\n- Peak Wind Forecast: 30-40 mph with gusts to 55 mph\n- Window for Tropical Storm force winds: Wednesday morning\nuntil Thursday afternoon\n\n- POTENTIAL THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY: Potential for wind 58 to\n73 mph\n- The wind threat has decreased from the previous assessment.\n- PLAN: Plan for dangerous wind of equivalent strong tropical\nstorm force due to possible forecast changes in track,\nsize, or intensity.\n- PREPARE: Remaining efforts to protect life and property\nshould be completed as soon as possible. Prepare for\nsignificant wind damage.\n- ACT: Move to safe shelter before the wind becomes hazardous.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Significant\n- Some damage to roofing and siding materials, along with\ndamage to porches, awnings, carports, and sheds. A few\nbuildings experiencing window, door, and garage door\nfailures. Mobile homes damaged, especially if unanchored.\nUnsecured lightweight objects become dangerous projectiles.\n- Several large trees snapped or uprooted, but with greater\nnumbers in places where trees are shallow rooted.\n- Some roads impassable from large debris, and more within\nurban or heavily wooded places. A few bridges and access\nroutes impassable.\n- Travel by vehicle or on foot increasingly difficult. Danger\nof death or injury from falling objects such as trees or\nelectric wires outside.\n- Scattered power and communications outages, but more\nprevalent in areas with above ground lines, which could\npersist for hours or days.\n- Some poorly secured small craft could break loose from\ntheir moorings.\n\n* STORM SURGE\n- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST: Life-threatening storm surge possible\n- Peak Storm Surge Inundation: The potential for 4-7 feet\nabove ground somewhere within surge prone areas\n- Window of concern: Begins early this morning\n\n- POTENTIAL THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY: Potential for storm\nsurge flooding greater than 6 feet above ground\n- The storm surge threat has remained nearly steady from the\nprevious assessment.\n- PLAN: Plan for life-threatening storm surge flooding of\ngreater than 6 feet above ground.\n- PREPARE: Evacuation preparations should be underway.\nAssemble disaster supplies and know your evacuation route.\n- ACT: Leave if evacuation orders are given for your area.\nFailure to heed evacuation orders may result in the loss of\nyour life.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Extensive\n- Large areas of deep inundation of saltwater along immediate\nshorelines and in low-lying spots farther inland near\nrivers and creeks, with storm surge flooding accentuated by\nbattering waves. Structural damage to buildings, with\nseveral washing away. Damage compounded by floating debris.\nLocations may be uninhabitable for an extended period.\n- Large sections of near-shore escape routes and secondary\nroads washed out or flooded and impassable. Flood control\nsystems and barriers could become stressed.\n- Severe beach erosion with significant dune loss.\n- Major damage to marinas, docks, boardwalks, and piers. Many\nsmall craft broken away from moorings, especially in\nunprotected anchorages, with some lifted onshore and\nstranded.\n- Drinking water and sewer services negatively impacted.\n- Hazardous containers and materials possibly present in\nsurge waters.\n\n* FLOODING RAIN\n- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST:\n- Peak Rainfall Amounts: Additional 3-6 inches, with locally\nhigher amounts\n\n- POTENTIAL THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY: Potential for moderate\nflooding rain\n- The flooding rain threat has remained nearly steady from\nthe previous assessment.\n- PLAN: Emergency plans should include the potential for\nmoderate flooding from heavy rain. Evacuations and rescues\nare possible.\n- PREPARE: Consider protective actions if you are in an area\nvulnerable to flooding.\n- ACT: Heed any flood watches and warnings. Failure to take\naction may result in serious injury or loss of life.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Significant\n- Moderate rainfall flooding could prompt some rescues.\n- Rivers and tributaries could quickly become swollen with\nswifter currents and overspill their banks in a few places,\nespecially in normally vulnerable spots. Small streams,\ncreeks, canals, and ditches overflow.\n- Flood waters can enter some structures or weaken\nfoundations. Several places could experience expanded areas\nof rapid inundation at underpasses, low-lying spots, and\npoor drainage areas. Some streets and parking lots take on\nmoving water as storm drains and retention ponds overflow.\nDriving conditions become hazardous. Some road and bridge\nclosures.\n\n* TORNADO\n- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST:\n- Situation is somewhat favorable for tornadoes\n\n- POTENTIAL THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY: Potential for a few\ntornadoes\n- The tornado threat has increased from the previous\nassessment.\n- PLAN: Emergency plans should include the potential for a\nfew tornadoes.\n- PREPARE: If your shelter is particularly vulnerable to\ntornadoes, prepare to relocate to safe shelter before\nhazardous weather arrives.\n- ACT: If a tornado warning is issued, be ready to shelter\nquickly.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Limited\n- Isolated tornadoes can hinder the execution of emergency\nplans.\n- Isolated locations could experience tornado damage, along\nwith power and communications disruptions.\n- In isolated locations, tornadoes could damage trees,\nvehicles, boats and buildings, especially mobile homes and\nother poorly constructed structures.\n\n* FOR MORE INFORMATION:\n- https://weather.gov/chs\n- https://ready.gov/hurricanes",

Prepare for considerable wind\ndamage.\n- ACT: Move to safe shelter before the wind becomes hazardous.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Extensive\n- Considerable roof damage to sturdy buildings, with some\nwindow, door, and garage door failures leading to\nstructural damage. Mobile homes severely damaged, with some\ndestroyed. Damage accentuated by airborne projectiles. Some\nlocations may be uninhabitable for weeks.\n- Danger of death or injury from falling objects and airborne\nprojectiles outside.\n- Large trees snapped or uprooted.\n- Some roads impassable from large debris, and more within\nurban or heavily wooded locations. Several bridges and\naccess routes impassable.\n- Large areas with power and communications outages, which\ncould persist for days.\n- Several secured small craft could break free from moorings.\n\n* STORM SURGE\n- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST: Life-threatening storm surge possible\n- Peak Storm Surge Inundation: The potential for 4-7 feet\nabove ground somewhere within surge prone areas\n- Window of concern: Begins Wednesday morning\n\n- POTENTIAL THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY: Potential for storm\nsurge flooding greater than 6 feet above ground\n- The storm surge threat has remained nearly steady from the\nprevious assessment.\n- PLAN: Plan for life-threatening storm surge flooding of\ngreater than 6 feet above ground.\n- PREPARE: Evacuation efforts should soon be brought to\ncompletion before driving conditions become unsafe.\n- ACT: Leave immediately if evacuation orders are given for\nyour area to avoid being cut off from emergency services or\nneedlessly risk lives.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Extensive\n- Large areas of deep inundation of saltwater along immediate\nshorelines and in low-lying spots farther inland near\nrivers and creeks, with storm surge flooding accentuated by\nbattering waves. Structural damage to buildings, with\nseveral washing away. Damage compounded by floating debris.\nLocations may be uninhabitable for an extended period.\n- Large sections of near-shore escape routes and secondary\nroads washed out or flooded and impassable. Flood control\nsystems and barriers could become stressed.\n- Severe beach erosion with significant dune loss.\n- Major damage to marinas, docks, boardwalks, and piers. Many\nsmall craft broken away from moorings, especially in\nunprotected anchorages, with some lifted onshore and\nstranded.\n- Drinking water and sewer services negatively impacted.\n- Hazardous containers and materials possibly present in\nsurge waters.\n\n* FLOODING RAIN\n- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST:\n- Peak Rainfall Amounts: 4-8 inches, with locally higher\namounts\n\n- POTENTIAL THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY: Potential for moderate\nflooding rain\n- The flooding rain threat has remained nearly steady from\nthe previous assessment.\n- PLAN: Emergency plans should include the potential for\nmoderate flooding from heavy rain. Evacuations and rescues\nare possible.\n- PREPARE: Consider protective actions if you are in an area\nvulnerable to flooding.\n- ACT: Heed any flood watches and warnings. Failure to take\naction may result in serious injury or loss of life.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Significant\n- Moderate rainfall flooding could prompt some rescues.\n- Rivers and tributaries could quickly become swollen with\nswifter currents and overspill their banks in a few places,\nespecially in normally vulnerable spots. Small streams,\ncreeks, canals, and ditches overflow.\n- Flood waters can enter some structures or weaken\nfoundations. Several places could experience expanded areas\nof rapid inundation at underpasses, low-lying spots, and\npoor drainage areas. Some streets and parking lots take on\nmoving water as storm drains and retention ponds overflow.\nDriving conditions become hazardous. Some road and bridge\nclosures.\n\n* TORNADO\n- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST:\n- Situation is somewhat favorable for tornadoes\n\n- POTENTIAL THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY: Potential for a few\ntornadoes\n- The tornado threat has increased from the previous\nassessment.\n- PLAN: Emergency plans should include the potential for a\nfew tornadoes.\n- PREPARE: If your shelter is particularly vulnerable to\ntornadoes, prepare to relocate to safe shelter before\nhazardous weather arrives.\n- ACT: If a tornado warning is issued, be ready to shelter\nquickly.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Limited\n- Isolated tornadoes can hinder the execution of emergency\nplans.\n- Isolated locations could experience tornado damage, along\nwith power and communications disruptions.\n- In isolated locations, tornadoes could damage trees,\nvehicles, boats and buildings, especially mobile homes and\nother poorly constructed structures.\n\n* FOR MORE INFORMATION:\n- https://weather.gov/chs\n- https://ready.gov/hurricanes",

        "description": "* LOCATIONS AFFECTED\n- Daniel Island\n- Red Bank Landing\n- Cainhoy\n\n* WIND\n- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST: Equivalent Tropical Storm force wind\n- Peak Wind Forecast: 40-50 mph with gusts to 65 mph\n- Window for Tropical Storm force winds: Wednesday evening\nuntil early Friday morning\n\n- POTENTIAL THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY: Potential for wind 74 to\n110 mph\n- The wind threat has remained nearly steady from the\nprevious assessment.\n- PLAN: Plan for life-threatening wind of equivalent CAT 1 or\n2 hurricane force due to possible forecast changes in\ntrack, size, or intensity.\n- PREPARE: Remaining efforts to protect life and property\nshould be urgently completed. Prepare for considerable wind\ndamage.\n- ACT: Move to safe shelter before the wind becomes hazardous.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Extensive\n- Considerable roof damage to sturdy buildings, with some\nwindow, door, and garage door failures leading to\nstructural damage. Mobile homes severely damaged, with some\ndestroyed. Damage accentuated by airborne projectiles. Some\nlocations may be uninhabitable for weeks.\n- Danger of death or injury from falling objects and airborne\nprojectiles outside.\n- Large trees snapped or uprooted.\n- Some roads impassable from large debris, and more within\nurban or heavily wooded locations. Several bridges and\naccess routes impassable.\n- Large areas with power and communications outages, which\ncould persist for days.\n- Several secured small craft could break free from moorings.\n\n* STORM SURGE\n- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST: Life-threatening storm surge possible\n- Peak Storm Surge Inundation: The potential for 4-7 feet\nabove ground somewhere within surge prone areas\n- Window of concern: Begins Wednesday morning\n\n- POTENTIAL THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY: Potential for storm\nsurge flooding greater than 6 feet above ground\n- The storm surge threat has remained nearly steady from the\nprevious assessment.\n- PLAN: Plan for life-threatening storm surge flooding of\ngreater than 6 feet above ground.\n- PREPARE: Evacuation efforts should soon be brought to\ncompletion before driving conditions become unsafe.\n- ACT: Leave immediately if evacuation orders are given for\nyour area to avoid being cut off from emergency services or\nneedlessly risk lives.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Extensive\n- Large areas of deep inundation of saltwater along immediate\nshorelines and in low-lying spots farther inland near\nrivers and creeks, with storm surge flooding accentuated by\nbattering waves. Structural damage to buildings, with\nseveral washing away. Damage compounded by floating debris.\nLocations may be uninhabitable for an extended period.\n- Large sections of near-shore escape routes and secondary\nroads washed out or flooded and impassable. Flood control\nsystems and barriers could become stressed.\n- Severe beach erosion with significant dune loss.\n- Major damage to marinas, docks, boardwalks, and piers. Many\nsmall craft broken away from moorings, especially in\nunprotected anchorages, with some lifted onshore and\nstranded.\n- Drinking water and sewer services negatively impacted.\n- Hazardous containers and materials possibly present in\nsurge waters.\n\n* FLOODING RAIN\n- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST:\n- Peak Rainfall Amounts: 4-8 inches, with locally higher\namounts\n\n- POTENTIAL THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY: Potential for major\nflooding rain\n- The flooding rain threat has increased from the previous\nassessment.\n- PLAN: Emergency plans should include the potential for\nmajor flooding from heavy rain. Evacuations and rescues are\nlikely.\n- PREPARE: Strongly consider protective actions, especially\nif you are in an area vulnerable to flooding.\n- ACT: Heed any flood watches and warnings. Failure to take\naction will likely result in serious injury or loss of life.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Extensive\n- Major rainfall flooding could prompt many rescues.\n- Rivers and tributaries could rapidly overflow their banks\nin multiple locations. Small streams, creeks, canals,\nditches may become dangerous rivers. Flood control systems\nand barriers could become stressed.\n- Flood waters could enter many structures within multiple\ncommunities; some structures become uninhabitable or are\nwashed away. Flood waters could cover multiple escape\nroutes. Streets and parking lots become rivers of moving\nwater with underpasses submerged. Driving conditions become\ndangerous. Many road and bridge closures with some weakened\nor washed out.\n- Drinking water and sewer services could be negatively\nimpacted.\n- Hazardous containers and materials could possibly be\npresent in flood waters.\n\n* TORNADO\n- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST:\n- Situation is somewhat favorable for tornadoes\n\n- POTENTIAL THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY: Potential for a few\ntornadoes\n- The tornado threat has increased from the previous\nassessment.\n- PLAN: Emergency plans should include the potential for a\nfew tornadoes.\n- PREPARE: If your shelter is particularly vulnerable to\ntornadoes, prepare to relocate to safe shelter before\nhazardous weather arrives.\n- ACT: If a tornado warning is issued, be ready to shelter\nquickly.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Limited\n- Isolated tornadoes can hinder the execution of emergency\nplans.\n- Isolated locations could experience tornado damage, along\nwith power and communications disruptions.\n- In isolated locations, tornadoes could damage trees,\nvehicles, boats and buildings, especially mobile homes and\nother poorly constructed structures.\n\n* FOR MORE INFORMATION:\n- https://weather.gov/chs\n- https://ready.gov/hurricanes",

Prepare for\nsignificant wind damage.\n- ACT: Move to safe shelter before the wind becomes hazardous.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Significant\n- Some damage to roofing and siding materials, along with\ndamage to porches, awnings, carports, and sheds. A few\nbuildings experiencing window, door, and garage door\nfailures. Mobile homes damaged, especially if unanchored.\nUnsecured lightweight objects become dangerous projectiles.\n- Several large trees snapped or uprooted, but with greater\nnumbers in places where trees are shallow rooted.\n- Some roads impassable from large debris, and more within\nurban or heavily wooded places. A few bridges and access\nroutes impassable.\n- Travel by vehicle or on foot increasingly difficult. Danger\nof death or injury from falling objects such as trees or\nelectric wires outside.\n- Scattered power and communications outages, but more\nprevalent in areas with above ground lines, which could\npersist for hours or days.\n- Some poorly secured small craft could break loose from\ntheir moorings.\n\n* FLOODING RAIN\n- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST:\n- Peak Rainfall Amounts: Additional 2-4 inches, with locally\nhigher amounts\n\n- POTENTIAL THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY: Potential for localized\nflooding rain\n- The flooding rain threat has remained nearly steady from\nthe previous assessment.\n- PLAN: Emergency plans should include the potential for\nlocalized flooding from heavy rain.\n- PREPARE: Consider protective actions if you are in an area\nvulnerable to flooding.\n- ACT: Heed any flood watches and warnings.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Limited\n- Localized rainfall flooding could prompt a few rescues.\n- Rivers and tributaries could quickly rise with swifter\ncurrents. Small streams, creeks, canals, and ditches could\nbecome swollen and overflow in spots.\n- Flood waters can enter a few structures, especially in\nnormally vulnerable spots. Rapid ponding of water could\noccur at underpasses, low-lying spots, and poor drainage\nareas. Several storm drains and retention ponds become\nnear-full and begin to overflow. Some brief road and bridge\nclosures.\n\n* TORNADO\n- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST:\n- Situation is unfavorable for tornadoes\n\n- POTENTIAL THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY: Tornadoes not expected\n- The tornado threat has remained nearly steady from the\nprevious assessment.\n- PLAN: Tornadoes are not expected. Showers and thunderstorms\nwith gusty winds may still occur.\n- PREPARE: Little to no preparations needed to protect\nagainst tornadoes at this time. Keep informed of the latest\ntornado situation.\n- ACT: Listen for changes in the forecast.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Little to None\n- Little to no potential impacts from tornadoes.\n\n* FOR MORE INFORMATION:\n- https://weather.gov/chs\n- https://ready.gov/hurricanes",

Prepare for considerable wind\ndamage.\n- ACT: Move to safe shelter before the wind becomes hazardous.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Extensive\n- Considerable roof damage to sturdy buildings, with some\nwindow, door, and garage door failures leading to\nstructural damage. Mobile homes severely damaged, with some\ndestroyed. Damage accentuated by airborne projectiles. Some\nlocations may be uninhabitable for weeks.\n- Danger of death or injury from falling objects and airborne\nprojectiles outside.\n- Large trees snapped or uprooted.\n- Some roads impassable from large debris, and more within\nurban or heavily wooded locations. Several bridges and\naccess routes impassable.\n- Large areas with power and communications outages, which\ncould persist for days.\n- Several secured small craft could break free from moorings.\n\n* STORM SURGE\n- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST: Life-threatening storm surge possible\n- Peak Storm Surge Inundation: The potential for 4-7 feet\nabove ground somewhere within surge prone areas\n- Window of concern: Begins early this morning\n\n- POTENTIAL THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY: Potential for storm\nsurge flooding greater than 6 feet above ground\n- The storm surge threat has remained nearly steady from the\nprevious assessment.\n- PLAN: Plan for life-threatening storm surge flooding of\ngreater than 6 feet above ground.\n- PREPARE: Evacuation preparations should be underway.\nAssemble disaster supplies and know your evacuation route.\n- ACT: Leave if evacuation orders are given for your area.\nFailure to heed evacuation orders may result in the loss of\nyour life.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Extensive\n- Large areas of deep inundation of saltwater along immediate\nshorelines and in low-lying spots farther inland near\nrivers and creeks, with storm surge flooding accentuated by\nbattering waves. Structural damage to buildings, with\nseveral washing away. Damage compounded by floating debris.\nLocations may be uninhabitable for an extended period.\n- Large sections of near-shore escape routes and secondary\nroads washed out or flooded and impassable. Flood control\nsystems and barriers could become stressed.\n- Severe beach erosion with significant dune loss.\n- Major damage to marinas, docks, boardwalks, and piers. Many\nsmall craft broken away from moorings, especially in\nunprotected anchorages, with some lifted onshore and\nstranded.\n- Drinking water and sewer services negatively impacted.\n- Hazardous containers and materials possibly present in\nsurge waters.\n\n* FLOODING RAIN\n- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST:\n- Peak Rainfall Amounts: Additional 3-6 inches, with locally\nhigher amounts\n\n- POTENTIAL THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY: Potential for moderate\nflooding rain\n- The flooding rain threat has remained nearly steady from\nthe previous assessment.\n- PLAN: Emergency plans should include the potential for\nmoderate flooding from heavy rain. Evacuations and rescues\nare possible.\n- PREPARE: Consider protective actions if you are in an area\nvulnerable to flooding.\n- ACT: Heed any flood watches and warnings. Failure to take\naction may result in serious injury or loss of life.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Significant\n- Moderate rainfall flooding could prompt some rescues.\n- Rivers and tributaries could quickly become swollen with\nswifter currents and overspill their banks in a few places,\nespecially in normally vulnerable spots. Small streams,\ncreeks, canals, and ditches overflow.\n- Flood waters can enter some structures or weaken\nfoundations. Several places could experience expanded areas\nof rapid inundation at underpasses, low-lying spots, and\npoor drainage areas. Some streets and parking lots take on\nmoving water as storm drains and retention ponds overflow.\nDriving conditions become hazardous. Some road and bridge\nclosures.\n\n* TORNADO\n- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST:\n- Situation is somewhat favorable for tornadoes\n\n- POTENTIAL THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY: Potential for a few\ntornadoes\n- The tornado threat has increased from the previous\nassessment.\n- PLAN: Emergency plans should include the potential for a\nfew tornadoes.\n- PREPARE: If your shelter is particularly vulnerable to\ntornadoes, prepare to relocate to safe shelter before\nhazardous weather arrives.\n- ACT: If a tornado warning is issued, be ready to shelter\nquickly.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Limited\n- Isolated tornadoes can hinder the execution of emergency\nplans.\n- Isolated locations could experience tornado damage, along\nwith power and communications disruptions.\n- In isolated locations, tornadoes could damage trees,\nvehicles, boats and buildings, especially mobile homes and\nother poorly constructed structures.\n\n* FOR MORE INFORMATION:\n- https://weather.gov/chs\n- https://ready.gov/hurricanes",

        "description": "* LOCATIONS AFFECTED\n- Daniel Island\n- Red Bank Landing\n- Cainhoy\n\n* WIND\n- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST: Equivalent Tropical Storm force wind\n- Peak Wind Forecast: 40-50 mph with gusts to 65 mph\n- Window for Tropical Storm force winds: Wednesday evening\nuntil early Friday morning\n\n- POTENTIAL THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY: Potential for wind 74 to\n110 mph\n- The wind threat has remained nearly steady from the\nprevious assessment.\n- PLAN: Plan for life-threatening wind of equivalent CAT 1 or\n2 hurricane force due to possible forecast changes in\ntrack, size, or intensity.\n- PREPARE: Remaining efforts to protect life and property\nshould be urgently completed. Prepare for considerable wind\ndamage.\n- ACT: Move to safe shelter before the wind becomes hazardous.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Extensive\n- Considerable roof damage to sturdy buildings, with some\nwindow, door, and garage door failures leading to\nstructural damage. Mobile homes severely damaged, with some\ndestroyed. Damage accentuated by airborne projectiles. Some\nlocations may be uninhabitable for weeks.\n- Danger of death or injury from falling objects and airborne\nprojectiles outside.\n- Large trees snapped or uprooted.\n- Some roads impassable from large debris, and more within\nurban or heavily wooded locations. Several bridges and\naccess routes impassable.\n- Large areas with power and communications outages, which\ncould persist for days.\n- Several secured small craft could break free from moorings.\n\n* STORM SURGE\n- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST: Life-threatening storm surge possible\n- Peak Storm Surge Inundation: The potential for 4-7 feet\nabove ground somewhere within surge prone areas\n- Window of concern: Begins Wednesday morning\n\n- POTENTIAL THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY: Potential for storm\nsurge flooding greater than 6 feet above ground\n- The storm surge threat has remained nearly steady from the\nprevious assessment.\n- PLAN: Plan for life-threatening storm surge flooding of\ngreater than 6 feet above ground.\n- PREPARE: Evacuation efforts should soon be brought to\ncompletion before driving conditions become unsafe.\n- ACT: Leave immediately if evacuation orders are given for\nyour area to avoid being cut off from emergency services or\nneedlessly risk lives.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Extensive\n- Large areas of deep inundation of saltwater along immediate\nshorelines and in low-lying spots farther inland near\nrivers and creeks, with storm surge flooding accentuated by\nbattering waves. Structural damage to buildings, with\nseveral washing away. Damage compounded by floating debris.\nLocations may be uninhabitable for an extended period.\n- Large sections of near-shore escape routes and secondary\nroads washed out or flooded and impassable. Flood control\nsystems and barriers could become stressed.\n- Severe beach erosion with significant dune loss.\n- Major damage to marinas, docks, boardwalks, and piers. Many\nsmall craft broken away from moorings, especially in\nunprotected anchorages, with some lifted onshore and\nstranded.\n- Drinking water and sewer services negatively impacted.\n- Hazardous containers and materials possibly present in\nsurge waters.\n\n* FLOODING RAIN\n- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST:\n- Peak Rainfall Amounts: 4-8 inches, with locally higher\namounts\n\n- POTENTIAL THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY: Potential for major\nflooding rain\n- The flooding rain threat has increased from the previous\nassessment.\n- PLAN: Emergency plans should include the potential for\nmajor flooding from heavy rain. Evacuations and rescues are\nlikely.\n- PREPARE: Strongly consider protective actions, especially\nif you are in an area vulnerable to flooding.\n- ACT: Heed any flood watches and warnings. Failure to take\naction will likely result in serious injury or loss of life.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Extensive\n- Major rainfall flooding could prompt many rescues.\n- Rivers and tributaries could rapidly overflow their banks\nin multiple locations. Small streams, creeks, canals,\nditches may become dangerous rivers. Flood control systems\nand barriers could become stressed.\n- Flood waters could enter many structures within multiple\ncommunities; some structures become uninhabitable or are\nwashed away. Flood waters could cover multiple escape\nroutes. Streets and parking lots become rivers of moving\nwater with underpasses submerged. Driving conditions become\ndangerous. Many road and bridge closures with some weakened\nor washed out.\n- Drinking water and sewer services could be negatively\nimpacted.\n- Hazardous containers and materials could possibly be\npresent in flood waters.\n\n* TORNADO\n- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST:\n- Situation is somewhat favorable for tornadoes\n\n- POTENTIAL THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY: Potential for a few\ntornadoes\n- The tornado threat has increased from the previous\nassessment.\n- PLAN: Emergency plans should include the potential for a\nfew tornadoes.\n- PREPARE: If your shelter is particularly vulnerable to\ntornadoes, prepare to relocate to safe shelter before\nhazardous weather arrives.\n- ACT: If a tornado warning is issued, be ready to shelter\nquickly.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Limited\n- Isolated tornadoes can hinder the execution of emergency\nplans.\n- Isolated locations could experience tornado damage, along\nwith power and communications disruptions.\n- In isolated locations, tornadoes could damage trees,\nvehicles, boats and buildings, especially mobile homes and\nother poorly constructed structures.\n\n* FOR MORE INFORMATION:\n- https://weather.gov/chs\n- https://ready.gov/hurricanes",

Prepare for\nsignificant wind damage.\n- ACT: Move to safe shelter before the wind becomes hazardous.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Significant\n- Some damage to roofing and siding materials, along with\ndamage to porches, awnings, carports, and sheds. A few\nbuildings experiencing window, door, and garage door\nfailures. Mobile homes damaged, especially if unanchored.\nUnsecured lightweight objects become dangerous projectiles.\n- Several large trees snapped or uprooted, but with greater\nnumbers in places where trees are shallow rooted.\n- Some roads impassable from large debris, and more within\nurban or heavily wooded places. A few bridges and access\nroutes impassable.\n- Travel by vehicle or on foot increasingly difficult. Danger\nof death or injury from falling objects such as trees or\nelectric wires outside.\n- Scattered power and communications outages, but more\nprevalent in areas with above ground lines, which could\npersist for hours or days.\n- Some poorly secured small craft could break loose from\ntheir moorings.\n\n* FLOODING RAIN\n- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST:\n- Peak Rainfall Amounts: Additional 2-4 inches, with locally\nhigher amounts\n\n- POTENTIAL THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY: Potential for localized\nflooding rain\n- The flooding rain threat has remained nearly steady from\nthe previous assessment.\n- PLAN: Emergency plans should include the potential for\nlocalized flooding from heavy rain.\n- PREPARE: Consider protective actions if you are in an area\nvulnerable to flooding.\n- ACT: Heed any flood watches and warnings.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Limited\n- Localized rainfall flooding could prompt a few rescues.\n- Rivers and tributaries could quickly rise with swifter\ncurrents. Small streams, creeks, canals, and ditches could\nbecome swollen and overflow in spots.\n- Flood waters can enter a few structures, especially in\nnormally vulnerable spots. Rapid ponding of water could\noccur at underpasses, low-lying spots, and poor drainage\nareas. Several storm drains and retention ponds become\nnear-full and begin to overflow. Some brief road and bridge\nclosures.\n\n* TORNADO\n- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST:\n- Situation is unfavorable for tornadoes\n\n- POTENTIAL THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY: Tornadoes not expected\n- The tornado threat has remained nearly steady from the\nprevious assessment.\n- PLAN: Tornadoes are not expected. Showers and thunderstorms\nwith gusty winds may still occur.\n- PREPARE: Little to no preparations needed to protect\nagainst tornadoes at this time. Keep informed of the latest\ntornado situation.\n- ACT: Listen for changes in the forecast.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Little to None\n- Little to no potential impacts from tornadoes.\n\n* FOR MORE INFORMATION:\n- https://weather.gov/chs\n- https://ready.gov/hurricanes",

        "description": "* LOCATIONS AFFECTED\n- Ridgeland\n- Hardeeville\n- Grays\n\n* WIND\n- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST: Below tropical storm force wind\n- Peak Wind Forecast: 25-35 mph with gusts to 50 mph\n\n- POTENTIAL THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY: Potential for wind 58 to\n73 mph\n- The wind threat has remained nearly steady from the\nprevious assessment.\n- PLAN: Plan for dangerous wind of equivalent strong tropical\nstorm force due to possible forecast changes in track,\nsize, or intensity.\n- PREPARE: Remaining efforts to protect life and property\nshould be completed as soon as possible. Prepare for\nsignificant wind damage.\n- ACT: Move to safe shelter before the wind becomes hazardous.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Significant\n- Some damage to roofing and siding materials, along with\ndamage to porches, awnings, carports, and sheds. A few\nbuildings experiencing window, door, and garage door\nfailures. Mobile homes damaged, especially if unanchored.\nUnsecured lightweight objects become dangerous projectiles.\n- Several large trees snapped or uprooted, but with greater\nnumbers in places where trees are shallow rooted.\n- Some roads impassable from large debris, and more within\nurban or heavily wooded places. A few bridges and access\nroutes impassable.\n- Travel by vehicle or on foot increasingly difficult. Danger\nof death or injury from falling objects such as trees or\nelectric wires outside.\n- Scattered power and communications outages, but more\nprevalent in areas with above ground lines, which could\npersist for hours or days.\n- Some poorly secured small craft could break loose from\ntheir moorings.\n\n* STORM SURGE\n- No storm surge inundation forecast\n\n- POTENTIAL THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY: Little to no storm surge\nflooding\n- The storm surge threat has remained nearly steady from the\nprevious assessment.\n- PLAN: There is little to no threat of storm surge flooding.\nRough surf, coastal erosion, and life-threatening rip\ncurrents are possible.\n- PREPARE: Little to no preparations for storm surge flooding\nare needed.\n- ACT: Follow the instructions of local officials. Monitor\nforecasts.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Little to None\n- Little to no potential impacts from saltwater inundation.\n\n* FLOODING RAIN\n- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST:\n- Peak Rainfall Amounts: Additional 3-6 inches, with locally\nhigher amounts\n\n- POTENTIAL THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY: Potential for moderate\nflooding rain\n- The flooding rain threat has remained nearly steady from\nthe previous assessment.\n- PLAN: Emergency plans should include the potential for\nmoderate flooding from heavy rain. Evacuations and rescues\nare possible.\n- PREPARE: Consider protective actions if you are in an area\nvulnerable to flooding.\n- ACT: Heed any flood watches and warnings. Failure to take\naction may result in serious injury or loss of life.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Significant\n- Moderate rainfall flooding could prompt some rescues.\n- Rivers and tributaries could quickly become swollen with\nswifter currents and overspill their banks in a few places,\nespecially in normally vulnerable spots. Small streams,\ncreeks, canals, and ditches overflow.\n- Flood waters can enter some structures or weaken\nfoundations. Several places could experience expanded areas\nof rapid inundation at underpasses, low-lying spots, and\npoor drainage areas. Some streets and parking lots take on\nmoving water as storm drains and retention ponds overflow.\nDriving conditions become hazardous. Some road and bridge\nclosures.\n\n* TORNADO\n- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST:\n- Situation is unfavorable for tornadoes\n\n- POTENTIAL THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY: Tornadoes not expected\n- The tornado threat has remained nearly steady from the\nprevious assessment.\n- PLAN: Tornadoes are not expected. Showers and thunderstorms\nwith gusty winds may still occur.\n- PREPARE: Little to no preparations needed to protect\nagainst tornadoes at this time. Keep informed of the latest\ntornado situation.\n- ACT: Listen for changes in the forecast.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Little to None\n- Little to no potential impacts from tornadoes.\n\n* FOR MORE INFORMATION:\n- https://weather.gov/chs\n- https://ready.gov/hurricanes",

        "description": "* LOCATIONS AFFECTED\n- Townsend\n- South Newport\n\n* WIND\n- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST: Below tropical storm force wind\n- Peak Wind Forecast: 25-35 mph with gusts to 50 mph\n\n- POTENTIAL THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY: Potential for wind 58 to\n73 mph\n- The wind threat has remained nearly steady from the\nprevious assessment.\n- PLAN: Plan for dangerous wind of equivalent strong tropical\nstorm force due to possible forecast changes in track,\nsize, or intensity.\n- PREPARE: Remaining efforts to protect life and property\nshould be completed as soon as possible. Prepare for\nsignificant wind damage.\n- ACT: Move to safe shelter before the wind becomes hazardous.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Significant\n- Some damage to roofing and siding materials, along with\ndamage to porches, awnings, carports, and sheds. A few\nbuildings experiencing window, door, and garage door\nfailures. Mobile homes damaged, especially if unanchored.\nUnsecured lightweight objects become dangerous projectiles.\n- Several large trees snapped or uprooted, but with greater\nnumbers in places where trees are shallow rooted.\n- Some roads impassable from large debris, and more within\nurban or heavily wooded places. A few bridges and access\nroutes impassable.\n- Travel by vehicle or on foot increasingly difficult. Danger\nof death or injury from falling objects such as trees or\nelectric wires outside.\n- Scattered power and communications outages, but more\nprevalent in areas with above ground lines, which could\npersist for hours or days.\n- Some poorly secured small craft could break loose from\ntheir moorings.\n\n* STORM SURGE\n- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST: Life-threatening storm surge possible\n- Peak Storm Surge Inundation: The potential for 4-7 feet\nabove ground somewhere within surge prone areas\n- Window of concern: Begins early this morning\n\n- POTENTIAL THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY: Potential for storm\nsurge flooding greater than 6 feet above ground\n- The storm surge threat has remained nearly steady from the\nprevious assessment.\n- PLAN: Shelter against life-threatening storm surge flooding\nof greater than 6 feet above ground.\n- PREPARE: All ordered evacuations should be complete.\nEvacuees should be in shelters well away from storm surge\nflooding.\n- ACT: Remain sheltered in a safe location. Do not venture\noutside. Move to upper floors to escape rising water if\nnecessary.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Unfolding\n- Potential impacts from the main surge event are unfolding.\n\n* FLOODING RAIN\n- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST:\n- Peak Rainfall Amounts: Additional 3-6 inches, with locally\nhigher amounts\n\n- POTENTIAL THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY: Potential for moderate\nflooding rain\n- The flooding rain threat has remained nearly steady from\nthe previous assessment.\n- PLAN: Emergency plans should include the potential for\nmoderate flooding from heavy rain. Evacuations and rescues\nare possible.\n- PREPARE: Consider protective actions if you are in an area\nvulnerable to flooding.\n- ACT: Heed any flood watches and warnings. Failure to take\naction may result in serious injury or loss of life.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Significant\n- Moderate rainfall flooding could prompt some rescues.\n- Rivers and tributaries could quickly become swollen with\nswifter currents and overspill their banks in a few places,\nespecially in normally vulnerable spots. Small streams,\ncreeks, canals, and ditches overflow.\n- Flood waters can enter some structures or weaken\nfoundations. Several places could experience expanded areas\nof rapid inundation at underpasses, low-lying spots, and\npoor drainage areas. Some streets and parking lots take on\nmoving water as storm drains and retention ponds overflow.\nDriving conditions become hazardous. Some road and bridge\nclosures.\n\n* TORNADO\n- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST:\n- Situation is somewhat favorable for tornadoes\n\n- POTENTIAL THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY: Potential for a few\ntornadoes\n- The tornado threat has increased from the previous\nassessment.\n- PLAN: Emergency plans should include the potential for a\nfew tornadoes.\n- PREPARE: If your shelter is particularly vulnerable to\ntornadoes, prepare to relocate to safe shelter before\nhazardous weather arrives.\n- ACT: If a tornado warning is issued, be ready to shelter\nquickly.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Limited\n- Isolated tornadoes can hinder the execution of emergency\nplans.\n- Isolated locations could experience tornado damage, along\nwith power and communications disruptions.\n- In isolated locations, tornadoes could damage trees,\nvehicles, boats and buildings, especially mobile homes and\nother poorly constructed structures.\n\n* FOR MORE INFORMATION:\n- https://weather.gov/chs\n- https://ready.gov/hurricanes",

Prepare for considerable wind\ndamage.\n- ACT: Move to safe shelter before the wind becomes hazardous.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Extensive\n- Considerable roof damage to sturdy buildings, with some\nwindow, door, and garage door failures leading to\nstructural damage. Mobile homes severely damaged, with some\ndestroyed. Damage accentuated by airborne projectiles. Some\nlocations may be uninhabitable for weeks.\n- Danger of death or injury from falling objects and airborne\nprojectiles outside.\n- Large trees snapped or uprooted.\n- Some roads impassable from large debris, and more within\nurban or heavily wooded locations. Several bridges and\naccess routes impassable.\n- Large areas with power and communications outages, which\ncould persist for days.\n- Several secured small craft could break free from moorings.\n\n* STORM SURGE\n- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST: Life-threatening storm surge possible\n- Peak Storm Surge Inundation: The potential for 4-7 feet\nabove ground somewhere within surge prone areas\n- Window of concern: Begins Wednesday morning\n\n- POTENTIAL THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY: Potential for storm\nsurge flooding greater than 6 feet above ground\n- The storm surge threat has remained nearly steady from the\nprevious assessment.\n- PLAN: Plan for life-threatening storm surge flooding of\ngreater than 6 feet above ground.\n- PREPARE: Evacuation efforts should soon be brought to\ncompletion before driving conditions become unsafe.\n- ACT: Leave immediately if evacuation orders are given for\nyour area to avoid being cut off from emergency services or\nneedlessly risk lives.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Extensive\n- Large areas of deep inundation of saltwater along immediate\nshorelines and in low-lying spots farther inland near\nrivers and creeks, with storm surge flooding accentuated by\nbattering waves. Structural damage to buildings, with\nseveral washing away. Damage compounded by floating debris.\nLocations may be uninhabitable for an extended period.\n- Large sections of near-shore escape routes and secondary\nroads washed out or flooded and impassable. Flood control\nsystems and barriers could become stressed.\n- Severe beach erosion with significant dune loss.\n- Major damage to marinas, docks, boardwalks, and piers. Many\nsmall craft broken away from moorings, especially in\nunprotected anchorages, with some lifted onshore and\nstranded.\n- Drinking water and sewer services negatively impacted.\n- Hazardous containers and materials possibly present in\nsurge waters.\n\n* FLOODING RAIN\n- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST:\n- Peak Rainfall Amounts: Additional 4-8 inches, with locally\nhigher amounts\n\n- POTENTIAL THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY: Potential for moderate\nflooding rain\n- The flooding rain threat has remained nearly steady from\nthe previous assessment.\n- PLAN: Emergency plans should include the potential for\nmoderate flooding from heavy rain. Evacuations and rescues\nare possible.\n- PREPARE: Consider protective actions if you are in an area\nvulnerable to flooding.\n- ACT: Heed any flood watches and warnings. Failure to take\naction may result in serious injury or loss of life.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Significant\n- Moderate rainfall flooding could prompt some rescues.\n- Rivers and tributaries could quickly become swollen with\nswifter currents and overspill their banks in a few places,\nespecially in normally vulnerable spots. Small streams,\ncreeks, canals, and ditches overflow.\n- Flood waters can enter some structures or weaken\nfoundations. Several places could experience expanded areas\nof rapid inundation at underpasses, low-lying spots, and\npoor drainage areas. Some streets and parking lots take on\nmoving water as storm drains and retention ponds overflow.\nDriving conditions become hazardous. Some road and bridge\nclosures.\n\n* TORNADO\n- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST:\n- Situation is somewhat favorable for tornadoes\n\n- POTENTIAL THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY: Potential for a few\ntornadoes\n- The tornado threat has increased from the previous\nassessment.\n- PLAN: Emergency plans should include the potential for a\nfew tornadoes.\n- PREPARE: If your shelter is particularly vulnerable to\ntornadoes, prepare to relocate to safe shelter before\nhazardous weather arrives.\n- ACT: If a tornado warning is issued, be ready to shelter\nquickly.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Limited\n- Isolated tornadoes can hinder the execution of emergency\nplans.\n- Isolated locations could experience tornado damage, along\nwith power and communications disruptions.\n- In isolated locations, tornadoes could damage trees,\nvehicles, boats and buildings, especially mobile homes and\nother poorly constructed structures.\n\n* FOR MORE INFORMATION:\n- https://weather.gov/chs\n- https://ready.gov/hurricanes\n- http://www.bcgov.net",

        "description": "* LOCATIONS AFFECTED\n- Hilton Head Island\n- Beaufort\n- Bluffton\n\n* WIND\n- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST: Equivalent Tropical Storm force wind\n- Peak Wind Forecast: 35-45 mph with gusts to 60 mph\n- Window for Tropical Storm force winds: Wednesday afternoon\nuntil Thursday afternoon\n\n- POTENTIAL THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY: Potential for wind 74 to\n110 mph\n- The wind threat has remained nearly steady from the\nprevious assessment.\n- PLAN: Plan for life-threatening wind of equivalent CAT 1 or\n2 hurricane force due to possible forecast changes in\ntrack, size, or intensity.\n- PREPARE: Remaining efforts to protect life and property\nshould be urgently completed. Prepare for considerable wind\ndamage.\n- ACT: Move to safe shelter before the wind becomes hazardous.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Extensive\n- Considerable roof damage to sturdy buildings, with some\nwindow, door, and garage door failures leading to\nstructural damage. Mobile homes severely damaged, with some\ndestroyed. Damage accentuated by airborne projectiles. Some\nlocations may be uninhabitable for weeks.\n- Danger of death or injury from falling objects and airborne\nprojectiles outside.\n- Large trees snapped or uprooted.\n- Some roads impassable from large debris, and more within\nurban or heavily wooded locations. Several bridges and\naccess routes impassable.\n- Large areas with power and communications outages, which\ncould persist for days.\n- Several secured small craft could break free from moorings.\n\n* STORM SURGE\n- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST: Life-threatening storm surge possible\n- Peak Storm Surge Inundation: The potential for 4-7 feet\nabove ground somewhere within surge prone areas\n- Window of concern: Begins Wednesday morning\n\n- POTENTIAL THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY: Potential for storm\nsurge flooding greater than 6 feet above ground\n- The storm surge threat has remained nearly steady from the\nprevious assessment.\n- PLAN: Plan for life-threatening storm surge flooding of\ngreater than 6 feet above ground.\n- PREPARE: Evacuation efforts should soon be brought to\ncompletion before driving conditions become unsafe.\n- ACT: Leave immediately if evacuation orders are given for\nyour area to avoid being cut off from emergency services or\nneedlessly risk lives.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Extensive\n- Large areas of deep inundation of saltwater along immediate\nshorelines and in low-lying spots farther inland near\nrivers and creeks, with storm surge flooding accentuated by\nbattering waves. Structural damage to buildings, with\nseveral washing away. Damage compounded by floating debris.\nLocations may be uninhabitable for an extended period.\n- Large sections of near-shore escape routes and secondary\nroads washed out or flooded and impassable. Flood control\nsystems and barriers could become stressed.\n- Severe beach erosion with significant dune loss.\n- Major damage to marinas, docks, boardwalks, and piers. Many\nsmall craft broken away from moorings, especially in\nunprotected anchorages, with some lifted onshore and\nstranded.\n- Drinking water and sewer services negatively impacted.\n- Hazardous containers and materials possibly present in\nsurge waters.\n\n* FLOODING RAIN\n- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST:\n- Peak Rainfall Amounts: Additional 4-8 inches, with locally\nhigher amounts\n\n- POTENTIAL THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY: Potential for moderate\nflooding rain\n- The flooding rain threat has remained nearly steady from\nthe previous assessment.\n- PLAN: Emergency plans should include the potential for\nmoderate flooding from heavy rain. Evacuations and rescues\nare possible.\n- PREPARE: Consider protective actions if you are in an area\nvulnerable to flooding.\n- ACT: Heed any flood watches and warnings. Failure to take\naction may result in serious injury or loss of life.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Significant\n- Moderate rainfall flooding could prompt some rescues.\n- Rivers and tributaries could quickly become swollen with\nswifter currents and overspill their banks in a few places,\nespecially in normally vulnerable spots. Small streams,\ncreeks, canals, and ditches overflow.\n- Flood waters can enter some structures or weaken\nfoundations. Several places could experience expanded areas\nof rapid inundation at underpasses, low-lying spots, and\npoor drainage areas. Some streets and parking lots take on\nmoving water as storm drains and retention ponds overflow.\nDriving conditions become hazardous. Some road and bridge\nclosures.\n\n* TORNADO\n- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST:\n- Situation is somewhat favorable for tornadoes\n\n- POTENTIAL THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY: Potential for a few\ntornadoes\n- The tornado threat has increased from the previous\nassessment.\n- PLAN: Emergency plans should include the potential for a\nfew tornadoes.\n- PREPARE: If your shelter is particularly vulnerable to\ntornadoes, prepare to relocate to safe shelter before\nhazardous weather arrives.\n- ACT: If a tornado warning is issued, be ready to shelter\nquickly.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Limited\n- Isolated tornadoes can hinder the execution of emergency\nplans.\n- Isolated locations could experience tornado damage, along\nwith power and communications disruptions.\n- In isolated locations, tornadoes could damage trees,\nvehicles, boats and buildings, especially mobile homes and\nother poorly constructed structures.\n\n* FOR MORE INFORMATION:\n- https://weather.gov/chs\n- https://ready.gov/hurricanes\n- http://www.bcgov.net",

Prepare for considerable wind\ndamage.\n- ACT: Move to safe shelter before the wind becomes hazardous.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Extensive\n- Considerable roof damage to sturdy buildings, with some\nwindow, door, and garage door failures leading to\nstructural damage. Mobile homes severely damaged, with some\ndestroyed. Damage accentuated by airborne projectiles. Some\nlocations may be uninhabitable for weeks.\n- Danger of death or injury from falling objects and airborne\nprojectiles outside.\n- Large trees snapped or uprooted.\n- Some roads impassable from large debris, and more within\nurban or heavily wooded locations. Several bridges and\naccess routes impassable.\n- Large areas with power and communications outages, which\ncould persist for days.\n- Several secured small craft could break free from moorings.\n\n* STORM SURGE\n- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST: Life-threatening storm surge possible\n- Peak Storm Surge Inundation: The potential for 4-7 feet\nabove ground somewhere within surge prone areas\n- Window of concern: Begins early this morning\n\n- POTENTIAL THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY: Potential for storm\nsurge flooding greater than 6 feet above ground\n- The storm surge threat has remained nearly steady from the\nprevious assessment.\n- PLAN: Plan for life-threatening storm surge flooding of\ngreater than 6 feet above ground.\n- PREPARE: Evacuation preparations should be underway.\nAssemble disaster supplies and know your evacuation route.\n- ACT: Leave if evacuation orders are given for your area.\nFailure to heed evacuation orders may result in the loss of\nyour life.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Extensive\n- Large areas of deep inundation of saltwater along immediate\nshorelines and in low-lying spots farther inland near\nrivers and creeks, with storm surge flooding accentuated by\nbattering waves. Structural damage to buildings, with\nseveral washing away. Damage compounded by floating debris.\nLocations may be uninhabitable for an extended period.\n- Large sections of near-shore escape routes and secondary\nroads washed out or flooded and impassable. Flood control\nsystems and barriers could become stressed.\n- Severe beach erosion with significant dune loss.\n- Major damage to marinas, docks, boardwalks, and piers. Many\nsmall craft broken away from moorings, especially in\nunprotected anchorages, with some lifted onshore and\nstranded.\n- Drinking water and sewer services negatively impacted.\n- Hazardous containers and materials possibly present in\nsurge waters.\n\n* FLOODING RAIN\n- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST:\n- Peak Rainfall Amounts: Additional 3-6 inches, with locally\nhigher amounts\n\n- POTENTIAL THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY: Potential for moderate\nflooding rain\n- The flooding rain threat has remained nearly steady from\nthe previous assessment.\n- PLAN: Emergency plans should include the potential for\nmoderate flooding from heavy rain. Evacuations and rescues\nare possible.\n- PREPARE: Consider protective actions if you are in an area\nvulnerable to flooding.\n- ACT: Heed any flood watches and warnings. Failure to take\naction may result in serious injury or loss of life.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Significant\n- Moderate rainfall flooding could prompt some rescues.\n- Rivers and tributaries could quickly become swollen with\nswifter currents and overspill their banks in a few places,\nespecially in normally vulnerable spots. Small streams,\ncreeks, canals, and ditches overflow.\n- Flood waters can enter some structures or weaken\nfoundations. Several places could experience expanded areas\nof rapid inundation at underpasses, low-lying spots, and\npoor drainage areas. Some streets and parking lots take on\nmoving water as storm drains and retention ponds overflow.\nDriving conditions become hazardous. Some road and bridge\nclosures.\n\n* TORNADO\n- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST:\n- Situation is somewhat favorable for tornadoes\n\n- POTENTIAL THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY: Potential for a few\ntornadoes\n- The tornado threat has increased from the previous\nassessment.\n- PLAN: Emergency plans should include the potential for a\nfew tornadoes.\n- PREPARE: If your shelter is particularly vulnerable to\ntornadoes, prepare to relocate to safe shelter before\nhazardous weather arrives.\n- ACT: If a tornado warning is issued, be ready to shelter\nquickly.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Limited\n- Isolated tornadoes can hinder the execution of emergency\nplans.\n- Isolated locations could experience tornado damage, along\nwith power and communications disruptions.\n- In isolated locations, tornadoes could damage trees,\nvehicles, boats and buildings, especially mobile homes and\nother poorly constructed structures.\n\n* FOR MORE INFORMATION:\n- https://weather.gov/chs\n- https://ready.gov/hurricanes",

        "description": "* LOCATIONS AFFECTED\n- Hampton\n- Estill\n- Early Branch\n\n* WIND\n- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST: Below tropical storm force wind\n- Peak Wind Forecast: 25-35 mph with gusts to 45 mph\n\n- POTENTIAL THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY: Potential for wind 58 to\n73 mph\n- The wind threat has increased from the previous assessment.\n- PLAN: Plan for dangerous wind of equivalent strong tropical\nstorm force due to possible forecast changes in track,\nsize, or intensity.\n- PREPARE: Remaining efforts to protect life and property\nshould be completed as soon as possible. Prepare for\nsignificant wind damage.\n- ACT: Move to safe shelter before the wind becomes hazardous.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Significant\n- Some damage to roofing and siding materials, along with\ndamage to porches, awnings, carports, and sheds. A few\nbuildings experiencing window, door, and garage door\nfailures. Mobile homes damaged, especially if unanchored.\nUnsecured lightweight objects become dangerous projectiles.\n- Several large trees snapped or uprooted, but with greater\nnumbers in places where trees are shallow rooted.\n- Some roads impassable from large debris, and more within\nurban or heavily wooded places. A few bridges and access\nroutes impassable.\n- Travel by vehicle or on foot increasingly difficult. Danger\nof death or injury from falling objects such as trees or\nelectric wires outside.\n- Scattered power and communications outages, but more\nprevalent in areas with above ground lines, which could\npersist for hours or days.\n- Some poorly secured small craft could break loose from\ntheir moorings.\n\n* FLOODING RAIN\n- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST:\n- Peak Rainfall Amounts: Additional 2-4 inches, with locally\nhigher amounts\n\n- POTENTIAL THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY: Potential for localized\nflooding rain\n- The flooding rain threat has remained nearly steady from\nthe previous assessment.\n- PLAN: Emergency plans should include the potential for\nlocalized flooding from heavy rain.\n- PREPARE: Consider protective actions if you are in an area\nvulnerable to flooding.\n- ACT: Heed any flood watches and warnings.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Limited\n- Localized rainfall flooding could prompt a few rescues.\n- Rivers and tributaries could quickly rise with swifter\ncurrents. Small streams, creeks, canals, and ditches could\nbecome swollen and overflow in spots.\n- Flood waters can enter a few structures, especially in\nnormally vulnerable spots. Rapid ponding of water could\noccur at underpasses, low-lying spots, and poor drainage\nareas. Several storm drains and retention ponds become\nnear-full and begin to overflow. Some brief road and bridge\nclosures.\n\n* TORNADO\n- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST:\n- Situation is unfavorable for tornadoes\n\n- POTENTIAL THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY: Tornadoes not expected\n- The tornado threat has remained nearly steady from the\nprevious assessment.\n- PLAN: Tornadoes are not expected. Showers and thunderstorms\nwith gusty winds may still occur.\n- PREPARE: Little to no preparations needed to protect\nagainst tornadoes at this time. Keep informed of the latest\ntornado situation.\n- ACT: Listen for changes in the forecast.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Little to None\n- Little to no potential impacts from tornadoes.\n\n* FOR MORE INFORMATION:\n- https://weather.gov/chs\n- https://ready.gov/hurricanes",

Prepare for considerable wind\ndamage.\n- ACT: Move to safe shelter before the wind becomes hazardous.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Extensive\n- Considerable roof damage to sturdy buildings, with some\nwindow, door, and garage door failures leading to\nstructural damage. Mobile homes severely damaged, with some\ndestroyed. Damage accentuated by airborne projectiles. Some\nlocations may be uninhabitable for weeks.\n- Danger of death or injury from falling objects and airborne\nprojectiles outside.\n- Large trees snapped or uprooted.\n- Some roads impassable from large debris, and more within\nurban or heavily wooded locations. Several bridges and\naccess routes impassable.\n- Large areas with power and communications outages, which\ncould persist for days.\n- Several secured small craft could break free from moorings.\n\n* STORM SURGE\n- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST: Life-threatening storm surge possible\n- Peak Storm Surge Inundation: The potential for 4-7 feet\nabove ground somewhere within surge prone areas\n- Window of concern: Begins early this morning\n\n- POTENTIAL THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY: Potential for storm\nsurge flooding greater than 6 feet above ground\n- The storm surge threat has remained nearly steady from the\nprevious assessment.\n- PLAN: Plan for life-threatening storm surge flooding of\ngreater than 6 feet above ground.\n- PREPARE: Evacuation preparations should be underway.\nAssemble disaster supplies and know your evacuation route.\n- ACT: Leave if evacuation orders are given for your area.\nFailure to heed evacuation orders may result in the loss of\nyour life.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Extensive\n- Large areas of deep inundation of saltwater along immediate\nshorelines and in low-lying spots farther inland near\nrivers and creeks, with storm surge flooding accentuated by\nbattering waves. Structural damage to buildings, with\nseveral washing away. Damage compounded by floating debris.\nLocations may be uninhabitable for an extended period.\n- Large sections of near-shore escape routes and secondary\nroads washed out or flooded and impassable. Flood control\nsystems and barriers could become stressed.\n- Severe beach erosion with significant dune loss.\n- Major damage to marinas, docks, boardwalks, and piers. Many\nsmall craft broken away from moorings, especially in\nunprotected anchorages, with some lifted onshore and\nstranded.\n- Drinking water and sewer services negatively impacted.\n- Hazardous containers and materials possibly present in\nsurge waters.\n\n* FLOODING RAIN\n- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST:\n- Peak Rainfall Amounts: Additional 3-6 inches, with locally\nhigher amounts\n\n- POTENTIAL THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY: Potential for moderate\nflooding rain\n- The flooding rain threat has remained nearly steady from\nthe previous assessment.\n- PLAN: Emergency plans should include the potential for\nmoderate flooding from heavy rain. Evacuations and rescues\nare possible.\n- PREPARE: Consider protective actions if you are in an area\nvulnerable to flooding.\n- ACT: Heed any flood watches and warnings. Failure to take\naction may result in serious injury or loss of life.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Significant\n- Moderate rainfall flooding could prompt some rescues.\n- Rivers and tributaries could quickly become swollen with\nswifter currents and overspill their banks in a few places,\nespecially in normally vulnerable spots. Small streams,\ncreeks, canals, and ditches overflow.\n- Flood waters can enter some structures or weaken\nfoundations. Several places could experience expanded areas\nof rapid inundation at underpasses, low-lying spots, and\npoor drainage areas. Some streets and parking lots take on\nmoving water as storm drains and retention ponds overflow.\nDriving conditions become hazardous. Some road and bridge\nclosures.\n\n* TORNADO\n- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST:\n- Situation is somewhat favorable for tornadoes\n\n- POTENTIAL THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY: Potential for a few\ntornadoes\n- The tornado threat has increased from the previous\nassessment.\n- PLAN: Emergency plans should include the potential for a\nfew tornadoes.\n- PREPARE: If your shelter is particularly vulnerable to\ntornadoes, prepare to relocate to safe shelter before\nhazardous weather arrives.\n- ACT: If a tornado warning is issued, be ready to shelter\nquickly.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Limited\n- Isolated tornadoes can hinder the execution of emergency\nplans.\n- Isolated locations could experience tornado damage, along\nwith power and communications disruptions.\n- In isolated locations, tornadoes could damage trees,\nvehicles, boats and buildings, especially mobile homes and\nother poorly constructed structures.\n\n* FOR MORE INFORMATION:\n- https://weather.gov/chs\n- https://ready.gov/hurricanes",

        "description": "* LOCATIONS AFFECTED\n- Townsend\n- South Newport\n\n* WIND\n- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST: Below tropical storm force wind\n- Peak Wind Forecast: 25-35 mph with gusts to 50 mph\n\n- POTENTIAL THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY: Potential for wind 58 to\n73 mph\n- The wind threat has remained nearly steady from the\nprevious assessment.\n- PLAN: Plan for dangerous wind of equivalent strong tropical\nstorm force due to possible forecast changes in track,\nsize, or intensity.\n- PREPARE: Remaining efforts to protect life and property\nshould be completed as soon as possible. Prepare for\nsignificant wind damage.\n- ACT: Move to safe shelter before the wind becomes hazardous.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Significant\n- Some damage to roofing and siding materials, along with\ndamage to porches, awnings, carports, and sheds. A few\nbuildings experiencing window, door, and garage door\nfailures. Mobile homes damaged, especially if unanchored.\nUnsecured lightweight objects become dangerous projectiles.\n- Several large trees snapped or uprooted, but with greater\nnumbers in places where trees are shallow rooted.\n- Some roads impassable from large debris, and more within\nurban or heavily wooded places. A few bridges and access\nroutes impassable.\n- Travel by vehicle or on foot increasingly difficult. Danger\nof death or injury from falling objects such as trees or\nelectric wires outside.\n- Scattered power and communications outages, but more\nprevalent in areas with above ground lines, which could\npersist for hours or days.\n- Some poorly secured small craft could break loose from\ntheir moorings.\n\n* STORM SURGE\n- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST: Life-threatening storm surge possible\n- Peak Storm Surge Inundation: The potential for 4-7 feet\nabove ground somewhere within surge prone areas\n- Window of concern: Begins early this morning\n\n- POTENTIAL THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY: Potential for storm\nsurge flooding greater than 6 feet above ground\n- The storm surge threat has remained nearly steady from the\nprevious assessment.\n- PLAN: Shelter against life-threatening storm surge flooding\nof greater than 6 feet above ground.\n- PREPARE: All ordered evacuations should be complete.\nEvacuees should be in shelters well away from storm surge\nflooding.\n- ACT: Remain sheltered in a safe location. Do not venture\noutside. Move to upper floors to escape rising water if\nnecessary.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Unfolding\n- Potential impacts from the main surge event are unfolding.\n\n* FLOODING RAIN\n- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST:\n- Peak Rainfall Amounts: Additional 3-6 inches, with locally\nhigher amounts\n\n- POTENTIAL THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY: Potential for moderate\nflooding rain\n- The flooding rain threat has remained nearly steady from\nthe previous assessment.\n- PLAN: Emergency plans should include the potential for\nmoderate flooding from heavy rain. Evacuations and rescues\nare possible.\n- PREPARE: Consider protective actions if you are in an area\nvulnerable to flooding.\n- ACT: Heed any flood watches and warnings. Failure to take\naction may result in serious injury or loss of life.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Significant\n- Moderate rainfall flooding could prompt some rescues.\n- Rivers and tributaries could quickly become swollen with\nswifter currents and overspill their banks in a few places,\nespecially in normally vulnerable spots. Small streams,\ncreeks, canals, and ditches overflow.\n- Flood waters can enter some structures or weaken\nfoundations. Several places could experience expanded areas\nof rapid inundation at underpasses, low-lying spots, and\npoor drainage areas. Some streets and parking lots take on\nmoving water as storm drains and retention ponds overflow.\nDriving conditions become hazardous. Some road and bridge\nclosures.\n\n* TORNADO\n- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST:\n- Situation is somewhat favorable for tornadoes\n\n- POTENTIAL THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY: Potential for a few\ntornadoes\n- The tornado threat has increased from the previous\nassessment.\n- PLAN: Emergency plans should include the potential for a\nfew tornadoes.\n- PREPARE: If your shelter is particularly vulnerable to\ntornadoes, prepare to relocate to safe shelter before\nhazardous weather arrives.\n- ACT: If a tornado warning is issued, be ready to shelter\nquickly.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Limited\n- Isolated tornadoes can hinder the execution of emergency\nplans.\n- Isolated locations could experience tornado damage, along\nwith power and communications disruptions.\n- In isolated locations, tornadoes could damage trees,\nvehicles, boats and buildings, especially mobile homes and\nother poorly constructed structures.\n\n* FOR MORE INFORMATION:\n- https://weather.gov/chs\n- https://ready.gov/hurricanes",

Prepare for considerable wind\ndamage.\n- ACT: Move to safe shelter before the wind becomes hazardous.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Extensive\n- Considerable roof damage to sturdy buildings, with some\nwindow, door, and garage door failures leading to\nstructural damage. Mobile homes severely damaged, with some\ndestroyed. Damage accentuated by airborne projectiles. Some\nlocations may be uninhabitable for weeks.\n- Danger of death or injury from falling objects and airborne\nprojectiles outside.\n- Large trees snapped or uprooted.\n- Some roads impassable from large debris, and more within\nurban or heavily wooded locations. Several bridges and\naccess routes impassable.\n- Large areas with power and communications outages, which\ncould persist for days.\n- Several secured small craft could break free from moorings.\n\n* STORM SURGE\n- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST: Life-threatening storm surge possible\n- Peak Storm Surge Inundation: The potential for 4-7 feet\nabove ground somewhere within surge prone areas\n- Window of concern: Begins Wednesday morning\n\n- POTENTIAL THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY: Potential for storm\nsurge flooding greater than 6 feet above ground\n- The storm surge threat has remained nearly steady from the\nprevious assessment.\n- PLAN: Plan for life-threatening storm surge flooding of\ngreater than 6 feet above ground.\n- PREPARE: Evacuation efforts should soon be brought to\ncompletion before driving conditions become unsafe.\n- ACT: Leave immediately if evacuation orders are given for\nyour area to avoid being cut off from emergency services or\nneedlessly risk lives.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Extensive\n- Large areas of deep inundation of saltwater along immediate\nshorelines and in low-lying spots farther inland near\nrivers and creeks, with storm surge flooding accentuated by\nbattering waves. Structural damage to buildings, with\nseveral washing away. Damage compounded by floating debris.\nLocations may be uninhabitable for an extended period.\n- Large sections of near-shore escape routes and secondary\nroads washed out or flooded and impassable. Flood control\nsystems and barriers could become stressed.\n- Severe beach erosion with significant dune loss.\n- Major damage to marinas, docks, boardwalks, and piers. Many\nsmall craft broken away from moorings, especially in\nunprotected anchorages, with some lifted onshore and\nstranded.\n- Drinking water and sewer services negatively impacted.\n- Hazardous containers and materials possibly present in\nsurge waters.\n\n* FLOODING RAIN\n- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST:\n- Peak Rainfall Amounts: 4-8 inches, with locally higher\namounts\n\n- POTENTIAL THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY: Potential for major\nflooding rain\n- The flooding rain threat has increased from the previous\nassessment.\n- PLAN: Emergency plans should include the potential for\nmajor flooding from heavy rain. Evacuations and rescues are\nlikely.\n- PREPARE: Strongly consider protective actions, especially\nif you are in an area vulnerable to flooding.\n- ACT: Heed any flood watches and warnings. Failure to take\naction will likely result in serious injury or loss of life.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Extensive\n- Major rainfall flooding could prompt many rescues.\n- Rivers and tributaries could rapidly overflow their banks\nin multiple locations. Small streams, creeks, canals,\nditches may become dangerous rivers. Flood control systems\nand barriers could become stressed.\n- Flood waters could enter many structures within multiple\ncommunities; some structures become uninhabitable or are\nwashed away. Flood waters could cover multiple escape\nroutes. Streets and parking lots become rivers of moving\nwater with underpasses submerged. Driving conditions become\ndangerous. Many road and bridge closures with some weakened\nor washed out.\n- Drinking water and sewer services could be negatively\nimpacted.\n- Hazardous containers and materials could possibly be\npresent in flood waters.\n\n* TORNADO\n- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST:\n- Situation is somewhat favorable for tornadoes\n\n- POTENTIAL THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY: Potential for a few\ntornadoes\n- The tornado threat has remained nearly steady from the\nprevious assessment.\n- PLAN: Emergency plans should include the potential for a\nfew tornadoes.\n- PREPARE: If your shelter is particularly vulnerable to\ntornadoes, prepare to relocate to safe shelter before\nhazardous weather arrives.\n- ACT: If a tornado warning is issued, be ready to shelter\nquickly.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Limited\n- Isolated tornadoes can hinder the execution of emergency\nplans.\n- Isolated locations could experience tornado damage, along\nwith power and communications disruptions.\n- In isolated locations, tornadoes could damage trees,\nvehicles, boats and buildings, especially mobile homes and\nother poorly constructed structures.\n\n* FOR MORE INFORMATION:\n- https://weather.gov/chs\n- https://ready.gov/hurricanes\n- https://www.charlestoncounty.org",

Prepare for considerable wind\ndamage.\n- ACT: Move to safe shelter before the wind becomes hazardous.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Extensive\n- Considerable roof damage to sturdy buildings, with some\nwindow, door, and garage door failures leading to\nstructural damage. Mobile homes severely damaged, with some\ndestroyed. Damage accentuated by airborne projectiles. Some\nlocations may be uninhabitable for weeks.\n- Danger of death or injury from falling objects and airborne\nprojectiles outside.\n- Large trees snapped or uprooted.\n- Some roads impassable from large debris, and more within\nurban or heavily wooded locations. Several bridges and\naccess routes impassable.\n- Large areas with power and communications outages, which\ncould persist for days.\n- Several secured small craft could break free from moorings.\n\n* STORM SURGE\n- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST: Life-threatening storm surge possible\n- Peak Storm Surge Inundation: The potential for 4-7 feet\nabove ground somewhere within surge prone areas\n- Window of concern: Begins Wednesday morning\n\n- POTENTIAL THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY: Potential for storm\nsurge flooding greater than 6 feet above ground\n- The storm surge threat has remained nearly steady from the\nprevious assessment.\n- PLAN: Plan for life-threatening storm surge flooding of\ngreater than 6 feet above ground.\n- PREPARE: Evacuation efforts should soon be brought to\ncompletion before driving conditions become unsafe.\n- ACT: Leave immediately if evacuation orders are given for\nyour area to avoid being cut off from emergency services or\nneedlessly risk lives.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Extensive\n- Large areas of deep inundation of saltwater along immediate\nshorelines and in low-lying spots farther inland near\nrivers and creeks, with storm surge flooding accentuated by\nbattering waves. Structural damage to buildings, with\nseveral washing away. Damage compounded by floating debris.\nLocations may be uninhabitable for an extended period.\n- Large sections of near-shore escape routes and secondary\nroads washed out or flooded and impassable. Flood control\nsystems and barriers could become stressed.\n- Severe beach erosion with significant dune loss.\n- Major damage to marinas, docks, boardwalks, and piers. Many\nsmall craft broken away from moorings, especially in\nunprotected anchorages, with some lifted onshore and\nstranded.\n- Drinking water and sewer services negatively impacted.\n- Hazardous containers and materials possibly present in\nsurge waters.\n\n* FLOODING RAIN\n- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST:\n- Peak Rainfall Amounts: Additional 3-6 inches, with locally\nhigher amounts\n\n- POTENTIAL THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY: Potential for moderate\nflooding rain\n- The flooding rain threat has remained nearly steady from\nthe previous assessment.\n- PLAN: Emergency plans should include the potential for\nmoderate flooding from heavy rain. Evacuations and rescues\nare possible.\n- PREPARE: Consider protective actions if you are in an area\nvulnerable to flooding.\n- ACT: Heed any flood watches and warnings. Failure to take\naction may result in serious injury or loss of life.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Significant\n- Moderate rainfall flooding could prompt some rescues.\n- Rivers and tributaries could quickly become swollen with\nswifter currents and overspill their banks in a few places,\nespecially in normally vulnerable spots. Small streams,\ncreeks, canals, and ditches overflow.\n- Flood waters can enter some structures or weaken\nfoundations. Several places could experience expanded areas\nof rapid inundation at underpasses, low-lying spots, and\npoor drainage areas. Some streets and parking lots take on\nmoving water as storm drains and retention ponds overflow.\nDriving conditions become hazardous. Some road and bridge\nclosures.\n\n* TORNADO\n- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST:\n- Situation is somewhat favorable for tornadoes\n\n- POTENTIAL THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY: Potential for a few\ntornadoes\n- The tornado threat has increased from the previous\nassessment.\n- PLAN: Emergency plans should include the potential for a\nfew tornadoes.\n- PREPARE: If your shelter is particularly vulnerable to\ntornadoes, prepare to relocate to safe shelter before\nhazardous weather arrives.\n- ACT: If a tornado warning is issued, be ready to shelter\nquickly.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Limited\n- Isolated tornadoes can hinder the execution of emergency\nplans.\n- Isolated locations could experience tornado damage, along\nwith power and communications disruptions.\n- In isolated locations, tornadoes could damage trees,\nvehicles, boats and buildings, especially mobile homes and\nother poorly constructed structures.\n\n* FOR MORE INFORMATION:\n- https://weather.gov/chs\n- https://ready.gov/hurricanes",

        "description": "* LOCATIONS AFFECTED\n- Charleston\n- McClellanville\n- Edisto Island\n\n* WIND\n- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST: Equivalent Tropical Storm force wind\n- Peak Wind Forecast: 45-55 mph with gusts to 70 mph\n- Window for Tropical Storm force winds: Wednesday evening\nuntil early Friday morning\n\n- POTENTIAL THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY: Potential for wind 74 to\n110 mph\n- The wind threat has remained nearly steady from the\nprevious assessment.\n- PLAN: Plan for life-threatening wind of equivalent CAT 1 or\n2 hurricane force due to possible forecast changes in\ntrack, size, or intensity.\n- PREPARE: Remaining efforts to protect life and property\nshould be urgently completed. Prepare for considerable wind\ndamage.\n- ACT: Move to safe shelter before the wind becomes hazardous.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Extensive\n- Considerable roof damage to sturdy buildings, with some\nwindow, door, and garage door failures leading to\nstructural damage. Mobile homes severely damaged, with some\ndestroyed. Damage accentuated by airborne projectiles. Some\nlocations may be uninhabitable for weeks.\n- Danger of death or injury from falling objects and airborne\nprojectiles outside.\n- Large trees snapped or uprooted.\n- Some roads impassable from large debris, and more within\nurban or heavily wooded locations. Several bridges and\naccess routes impassable.\n- Large areas with power and communications outages, which\ncould persist for days.\n- Several secured small craft could break free from moorings.\n\n* STORM SURGE\n- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST: Life-threatening storm surge possible\n- Peak Storm Surge Inundation: The potential for 4-7 feet\nabove ground somewhere within surge prone areas\n- Window of concern: Begins Wednesday morning\n\n- POTENTIAL THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY: Potential for storm\nsurge flooding greater than 6 feet above ground\n- The storm surge threat has remained nearly steady from the\nprevious assessment.\n- PLAN: Plan for life-threatening storm surge flooding of\ngreater than 6 feet above ground.\n- PREPARE: Evacuation efforts should soon be brought to\ncompletion before driving conditions become unsafe.\n- ACT: Leave immediately if evacuation orders are given for\nyour area to avoid being cut off from emergency services or\nneedlessly risk lives.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Extensive\n- Large areas of deep inundation of saltwater along immediate\nshorelines and in low-lying spots farther inland near\nrivers and creeks, with storm surge flooding accentuated by\nbattering waves. Structural damage to buildings, with\nseveral washing away. Damage compounded by floating debris.\nLocations may be uninhabitable for an extended period.\n- Large sections of near-shore escape routes and secondary\nroads washed out or flooded and impassable. Flood control\nsystems and barriers could become stressed.\n- Severe beach erosion with significant dune loss.\n- Major damage to marinas, docks, boardwalks, and piers. Many\nsmall craft broken away from moorings, especially in\nunprotected anchorages, with some lifted onshore and\nstranded.\n- Drinking water and sewer services negatively impacted.\n- Hazardous containers and materials possibly present in\nsurge waters.\n\n* FLOODING RAIN\n- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST:\n- Peak Rainfall Amounts: 4-8 inches, with locally higher\namounts\n\n- POTENTIAL THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY: Potential for major\nflooding rain\n- The flooding rain threat has increased from the previous\nassessment.\n- PLAN: Emergency plans should include the potential for\nmajor flooding from heavy rain. Evacuations and rescues are\nlikely.\n- PREPARE: Strongly consider protective actions, especially\nif you are in an area vulnerable to flooding.\n- ACT: Heed any flood watches and warnings. Failure to take\naction will likely result in serious injury or loss of life.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Extensive\n- Major rainfall flooding could prompt many rescues.\n- Rivers and tributaries could rapidly overflow their banks\nin multiple locations. Small streams, creeks, canals,\nditches may become dangerous rivers. Flood control systems\nand barriers could become stressed.\n- Flood waters could enter many structures within multiple\ncommunities; some structures become uninhabitable or are\nwashed away. Flood waters could cover multiple escape\nroutes. Streets and parking lots become rivers of moving\nwater with underpasses submerged. Driving conditions become\ndangerous. Many road and bridge closures with some weakened\nor washed out.\n- Drinking water and sewer services could be negatively\nimpacted.\n- Hazardous containers and materials could possibly be\npresent in flood waters.\n\n* TORNADO\n- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST:\n- Situation is somewhat favorable for tornadoes\n\n- POTENTIAL THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY: Potential for a few\ntornadoes\n- The tornado threat has remained nearly steady from the\nprevious assessment.\n- PLAN: Emergency plans should include the potential for a\nfew tornadoes.\n- PREPARE: If your shelter is particularly vulnerable to\ntornadoes, prepare to relocate to safe shelter before\nhazardous weather arrives.\n- ACT: If a tornado warning is issued, be ready to shelter\nquickly.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Limited\n- Isolated tornadoes can hinder the execution of emergency\nplans.\n- Isolated locations could experience tornado damage, along\nwith power and communications disruptions.\n- In isolated locations, tornadoes could damage trees,\nvehicles, boats and buildings, especially mobile homes and\nother poorly constructed structures.\n\n* FOR MORE INFORMATION:\n- https://weather.gov/chs\n- https://ready.gov/hurricanes\n- https://www.charlestoncounty.org",

Prepare for considerable wind\ndamage.\n- ACT: Move to safe shelter before the wind becomes hazardous.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Extensive\n- Considerable roof damage to sturdy buildings, with some\nwindow, door, and garage door failures leading to\nstructural damage. Mobile homes severely damaged, with some\ndestroyed. Damage accentuated by airborne projectiles. Some\nlocations may be uninhabitable for weeks.\n- Danger of death or injury from falling objects and airborne\nprojectiles outside.\n- Large trees snapped or uprooted.\n- Some roads impassable from large debris, and more within\nurban or heavily wooded locations. Several bridges and\naccess routes impassable.\n- Large areas with power and communications outages, which\ncould persist for days.\n- Several secured small craft could break free from moorings.\n\n* STORM SURGE\n- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST: Life-threatening storm surge possible\n- Peak Storm Surge Inundation: The potential for 4-7 feet\nabove ground somewhere within surge prone areas\n- Window of concern: Begins Wednesday morning\n\n- POTENTIAL THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY: Potential for storm\nsurge flooding greater than 6 feet above ground\n- The storm surge threat has remained nearly steady from the\nprevious assessment.\n- PLAN: Plan for life-threatening storm surge flooding of\ngreater than 6 feet above ground.\n- PREPARE: Evacuation efforts should soon be brought to\ncompletion before driving conditions become unsafe.\n- ACT: Leave immediately if evacuation orders are given for\nyour area to avoid being cut off from emergency services or\nneedlessly risk lives.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Extensive\n- Large areas of deep inundation of saltwater along immediate\nshorelines and in low-lying spots farther inland near\nrivers and creeks, with storm surge flooding accentuated by\nbattering waves. Structural damage to buildings, with\nseveral washing away. Damage compounded by floating debris.\nLocations may be uninhabitable for an extended period.\n- Large sections of near-shore escape routes and secondary\nroads washed out or flooded and impassable. Flood control\nsystems and barriers could become stressed.\n- Severe beach erosion with significant dune loss.\n- Major damage to marinas, docks, boardwalks, and piers. Many\nsmall craft broken away from moorings, especially in\nunprotected anchorages, with some lifted onshore and\nstranded.\n- Drinking water and sewer services negatively impacted.\n- Hazardous containers and materials possibly present in\nsurge waters.\n\n* FLOODING RAIN\n- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST:\n- Peak Rainfall Amounts: Additional 3-6 inches, with locally\nhigher amounts\n\n- POTENTIAL THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY: Potential for moderate\nflooding rain\n- The flooding rain threat has remained nearly steady from\nthe previous assessment.\n- PLAN: Emergency plans should include the potential for\nmoderate flooding from heavy rain. Evacuations and rescues\nare possible.\n- PREPARE: Consider protective actions if you are in an area\nvulnerable to flooding.\n- ACT: Heed any flood watches and warnings. Failure to take\naction may result in serious injury or loss of life.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Significant\n- Moderate rainfall flooding could prompt some rescues.\n- Rivers and tributaries could quickly become swollen with\nswifter currents and overspill their banks in a few places,\nespecially in normally vulnerable spots. Small streams,\ncreeks, canals, and ditches overflow.\n- Flood waters can enter some structures or weaken\nfoundations. Several places could experience expanded areas\nof rapid inundation at underpasses, low-lying spots, and\npoor drainage areas. Some streets and parking lots take on\nmoving water as storm drains and retention ponds overflow.\nDriving conditions become hazardous. Some road and bridge\nclosures.\n\n* TORNADO\n- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST:\n- Situation is somewhat favorable for tornadoes\n\n- POTENTIAL THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY: Potential for a few\ntornadoes\n- The tornado threat has increased from the previous\nassessment.\n- PLAN: Emergency plans should include the potential for a\nfew tornadoes.\n- PREPARE: If your shelter is particularly vulnerable to\ntornadoes, prepare to relocate to safe shelter before\nhazardous weather arrives.\n- ACT: If a tornado warning is issued, be ready to shelter\nquickly.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Limited\n- Isolated tornadoes can hinder the execution of emergency\nplans.\n- Isolated locations could experience tornado damage, along\nwith power and communications disruptions.\n- In isolated locations, tornadoes could damage trees,\nvehicles, boats and buildings, especially mobile homes and\nother poorly constructed structures.\n\n* FOR MORE INFORMATION:\n- https://weather.gov/chs\n- https://ready.gov/hurricanes",

        "description": "This product covers Northeast Florida and Southeast Georgia\n\n**DORIAN STILL NEARLY STATIONARY BUT EXPECTED TO BEGIN MOVING\nNORTH-NORTHWESTWARD LATER THIS MORNING**\n\nNEW INFORMATION\n---------------\n\n* CHANGES TO WATCHES AND WARNINGS:\n- The Tropical Storm Watch has been upgraded to a Tropical Storm\nWarning for Inland Camden, Inland Duval, Inland Glynn, and\nInland Nassau\n- A Tropical Storm Warning has been issued for Coastal Camden,\nCoastal Duval, Coastal Glynn, and Coastal Nassau\n\n* CURRENT WATCHES AND WARNINGS:\n- A Storm Surge Warning and Tropical Storm Warning are in effect\nfor Inland Glynn\n- A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for Clay, Eastern Marion,\nInland Camden, Inland Duval, Inland Nassau, and Putnam\n- A Storm Surge Warning, Tropical Storm Warning, and Hurricane\nWatch are in effect for Coastal Camden, Coastal Duval, Coastal\nGlynn, and Coastal Nassau\n- A Hurricane Warning is in effect for Inland Flagler and Inland\nSt. Johns\n- A Storm Surge Warning and Hurricane Warning are in effect for\nCoastal Flagler and Coastal St. Johns\n\n* STORM INFORMATION:\n- About 300 miles southeast of Jacksonville FL or about 280 miles\nsoutheast of St. Augustine FL\n- 26.9N 78.4W\n- Storm Intensity 120 mph\n- Movement Stationary\n\nSITUATION OVERVIEW\n------------------\n\nHurricane Dorian has weakened modestly in the past several hours,\nbut remains a major hurricane with peak winds near 120\nmph. Dorian has been nearly stationary yesterday and most of the\nnight, but is finally showing signs that it will soon resume a more\nnortherly course. Today, the storm is forecast to begin to move away from\nthe Bahamas and slowly towards the Florida coast. As Dorian approaches,\nit is forecast to run parallel to the Florida coastline into Wednesday.\n\nWith a track that is parallel and close to the coast, small east-west\nchanges in the forecast track could have large influences on the\nthreat to Northeast Florida for damaging winds and life-threatening\nstorm surge. If Dorian were to approach even closer, it would produce\nmore serious impacts to coastal areas. For this reason, both a\ntropical storm warning and a hurricane watch are in effect.\n\nListen to local officials and heed evacuation orders as given. Large\nbattering waves and higher than normal tides will add to the\ndestructive potential, along with beach erosion.\n\nHeavy rainfall is forecast over eastern parts of northeast Florida and\ncoastal southeast Georgia and with total accumulations of 3 to\n6 inches, with maximum isolated rainfall amounts to 8 inches along the\neast coast. Flash flooding is possible, especially in urban and poorly\ndrained areas.\n\nPOTENTIAL IMPACTS\n-----------------\n\n* SURGE:\nProtect against life-threatening surge having possible extensive\nimpacts across the beaches of northeast Florida and southeast Georgia.\nPotential impacts in this area include:\n- Large areas of deep inundation with storm surge flooding\naccentuated by battering waves. Structural damage to buildings,\nwith several washing away. Damage compounded by floating\ndebris. Locations may be uninhabitable for an extended period.\n- Large sections of near-shore escape routes and secondary roads\nwashed out or severely flooded. Flood control systems and\nbarriers may become stressed.\n- Severe beach erosion with significant dune loss.\n- Major damage to marinas, docks, boardwalks, and piers. Many\nsmall craft broken away from moorings, especially in\nunprotected anchorages with some lifted onshore and stranded.\n\n* WIND:\nProtect against life-threatening wind having possible extensive\nimpacts across coastal areas across northeast Florida and southeast\nGeorgia. Potential impacts in this area include:\n- Considerable roof damage to sturdy buildings, with some having\nwindow, door, and garage door failures leading to structural\ndamage. Mobile homes severely damaged, with some destroyed.\nDamage accentuated by airborne projectiles. Locations may be\nuninhabitable for weeks.\n- Many large trees snapped or uprooted along with fences and\nroadway signs blown over.\n- Some roads impassable from large debris, and more within urban\nor heavily wooded places. Several bridges, causeways, and\naccess routes impassable.\n- Large areas with power and communications outages.\n\nAlso, protect against dangerous wind having possible limited to\nsignificant impacts across adjacent inland portions of northeast\nFlorida and southeast Georgia.\n\nElsewhere across Northeast Florida and Southeast Georgia, little to\nno impact is anticipated.\n\n* FLOODING RAIN:\nProtect against dangerous rainfall flooding having possible\nsignificant impacts across coastal counties of northeast Florida and\nsoutheast Georgia. Potential impacts include:\n- Moderate rainfall flooding may prompt several evacuations and\nrescues.\n- Rivers and tributaries may quickly become swollen with swifter\ncurrents and overspill their banks in a few places, especially\nin usually vulnerable spots. Small streams, creeks, canals, and\nditches overflow.\n- Flood waters can enter some structures or weaken foundations.\nSeveral places may experience expanded areas of rapid\ninundation at underpasses, low-lying spots, and poor drainage\nareas. Some streets and parking lots take on moving water as\nstorm drains and retention ponds overflow. Driving conditions\nbecome hazardous. Some road and bridge closures.\n\nProtect against locally hazardous rainfall flooding having possible\nlimited impacts across inland portions of northeast Florida and southeast\nGeorgia.",
        "instruction": "* EVACUATIONS:\nListen to local official for recommended preparedness actions, including\npossible evacuation. If ordered to evacuate, do so immediately.\n\nFor those not under evacuation orders, assess the risk from wind, falling\ntrees, and flooding at your location. If you decide to move, relocate to\na safer location nearby. If you do not relocate, help keep roadways open\nfor those under evacuation orders.\n\nIf evacuating, leave with a destination in mind and allow extra time to\nget there. Take your emergency supplies kit. Gas up your vehicle ahead of\ntime.\n\nLet others know where you are going prior to departure. Secure loose items\nand pets in the car, and avoid distracted driving.\n\n* OTHER PREPAREDNESS INFORMATION:\nNow is the time to complete all preparations to protect life and\nproperty in accordance with your emergency plan. Ensure you are in a\nsafe location before the onset of strong winds or possible flooding.\n\nIf you are relocating to safe shelter, leave as early as possible.\nAllow extra time to reach your destination. Many roads and bridges\nwill be closed once strong winds arrive. Check the latest weather\nforecast before departing and drive with caution.\n\nIf heading to a community shelter, become familiar with the shelter\nrules before arrival, especially if you have special needs or have\npets. Take essential items with you from your Emergency Supplies Kit.\n\nIf you are a visitor, be sure to know the name of the city or town in\nwhich you are staying and the name of the county or parish in which\nit resides. Listen for these locations in local news updates. Pay\nattention for instructions from local authorities.\n\nStorm surge is the leading killer associated with tropical storms and\nhurricanes! Make sure you are in a safe area away from the surge\nzone. Even if you are not in a surge-prone area, you could find\nyourself cutoff by flood waters during and after the storm. Heed\nevacuation orders issued by the local authorities.\n\nClosely monitor weather.gov, NOAA Weather radio or local news outlets\nfor official storm information. Be ready to adapt to possible changes\nto the forecast. Ensure you have multiple ways to receive weather\nwarnings.\n\n* ADDITIONAL SOURCES OF INFORMATION:\n- For information on appropriate preparations see ready.gov\n- For information on creating an emergency plan see getagameplan.org\n- For additional disaster preparedness information see redcross.org",

Prepare for limited wind\ndamage.\n- ACT: Move to safe shelter before the wind becomes hazardous.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Limited\n- Damage to porches, awnings, carports, sheds, and unanchored\nmobile homes. Unsecured lightweight objects blown about.\n- Many large tree limbs broken off. A few trees snapped or\nuprooted, but with greater numbers in places where trees\nare shallow rooted. Some fences and roadway signs blown\nover.\n- A few roads impassable from debris, particularly within\nurban or heavily wooded places. Hazardous driving\nconditions on bridges and other elevated roadways.\n- Scattered power and communications outages.\n\n* STORM SURGE\n- No storm surge inundation forecast\n\n- POTENTIAL THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY: Little to no storm surge\nflooding\n- The storm surge threat has remained nearly steady from the\nprevious assessment.\n- PLAN: There is little to no threat of storm surge flooding.\nRough surf, coastal erosion, and life-threatening rip\ncurrents are possible.\n- PREPARE: Little to no preparations for storm surge flooding\nare needed.\n- ACT: Follow the instructions of local officials. Monitor\nforecasts.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Little to None\n- Little to no potential impacts from storm surge flooding.\n\n* FLOODING RAIN\n- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST:\n- Peak Rainfall Amounts: Additional around 1 inch\n\n- POTENTIAL THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY: Potential for localized\nflooding rain\n- The flooding rain threat has remained nearly steady from\nthe previous assessment.\n- PLAN: Emergency plans should include the potential for\nlocalized flooding from heavy rain.\n- PREPARE: Consider protective actions if you are in an area\nvulnerable to flooding.\n- ACT: Heed any flood watches and warnings.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Limited\n- Localized rainfall flooding may prompt a few evacuations.\n- Ditches and canals may quickly rise with swift currents.\n- Flood waters can enter a few structures, especially in\nusually vulnerable spots. A few places where rapid ponding\nof water occurs at underpasses, low-lying spots, and poor\ndrainage areas. Several storm drains and retention ponds\nbecome near-full and begin to overflow. Some brief road and\nbridge closures.\n\n* TORNADO\n- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST:\n- Situation is somewhat favorable for tornadoes\n\n- POTENTIAL THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY: Potential for a few\ntornadoes\n- The tornado threat has remained nearly steady from the\nprevious assessment.\n- PLAN: Emergency plans should include the potential for a\nfew tornadoes.\n- PREPARE: If your shelter is particularly vulnerable to\ntornadoes, prepare to relocate to safe shelter before\nhazardous weather arrives.\n- ACT: If a tornado warning is issued, be ready to shelter\nquickly.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Limited\n- The occurrence of isolated tornadoes can hinder the\nexecution of emergency plans during tropical events.\n- A few places may experience tornado damage, along with\npower and communications disruptions.\n- Locations could realize roofs peeled off buildings, mobile\nhomes pushed off foundations or overturned, large tree tops\nand branches snapped off, shallow-rooted trees knocked\nover, moving vehicles blown off roads, and small boats\npulled from moorings.\n\n* FOR MORE INFORMATION:\n- https://www.weather.gov/mfl\n- www.broward.org/hurricane\n- For storm information call 3-1-1",

Prepare for\nsignificant wind damage.\n- ACT: Move to safe shelter before the wind becomes hazardous.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Significant\n- Some damage to roofing and siding materials, along with\ndamage to porches, awnings, carports, and sheds. A few\nbuildings experiencing window, door, and garage door\nfailures. Mobile homes damaged, especially if unanchored.\nUnsecured lightweight objects become dangerous projectiles.\n- Several large trees snapped or uprooted, but with greater\nnumbers in places where trees are shallow rooted. Several\nfences and roadway signs blown over.\n- Some roads impassable from large debris, and more within\nurban or heavily wooded places. A few bridges, causeways,\nand access routes impassable.\n- Scattered power and communications outages, but more\nprevalent in areas with above ground lines.\n\n* STORM SURGE\n- No storm surge inundation forecast\n\n- POTENTIAL THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY: Little to no storm surge\nflooding\n- The storm surge threat has remained nearly steady from the\nprevious assessment.\n- PLAN: The threat from storm surge is diminishing as flood\nwaters recede.\n- PREPARE: Heed instructions from local officials when moving\nabout. Do not enter flooded areas.\n- ACT: Exercise safety.\n\n- REALIZED IMPACTS: Being Assessed\n- Little to no additional surge impacts expected. Community\nofficials are now assessing the extent of actual surge\nimpacts accordingly.\n\n* FLOODING RAIN\n- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST:\n- Peak Rainfall Amounts: Additional 3-6 inches, with locally\nhigher amounts\n\n- POTENTIAL THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY: Potential for localized\nflooding rain\n- The flooding rain threat has remained nearly steady from\nthe previous assessment.\n- PLAN: Emergency plans should include the potential for\nlocalized flooding from heavy rain.\n- PREPARE: Consider protective actions if you are in an area\nvulnerable to flooding.\n- ACT: Heed any flood watches and warnings.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Limited\n- Localized rainfall flooding may prompt a few evacuations.\n- Rivers and tributaries may quickly rise with swifter\ncurrents. Small streams, creeks, canals, and ditches may\nbecome swollen and overflow in spots.\n- Flood waters can enter a few structures, especially in\nusually vulnerable spots. A few places where rapid ponding\nof water occurs at underpasses, low-lying spots, and poor\ndrainage areas. Several storm drains and retention ponds\nbecome near-full and begin to overflow. Some brief road and\nbridge closures.\n\n* TORNADO\n- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST:\n- Situation is somewhat favorable for tornadoes\n\n- POTENTIAL THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY: Potential for a few\ntornadoes\n- The tornado threat has increased from the previous\nassessment.\n- PLAN: Emergency plans should include the potential for a\nfew tornadoes.\n- PREPARE: If your shelter is particularly vulnerable to\ntornadoes, prepare to relocate to safe shelter before\nhazardous weather arrives.\n- ACT: If a tornado warning is issued, be ready to shelter\nquickly.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Limited\n- The occurrence of isolated tornadoes can hinder the\nexecution of emergency plans during tropical events.\n- A few places may experience tornado damage, along with\npower and communications disruptions.\n- Locations could realize roofs peeled off buildings,\nchimneys toppled, mobile homes pushed off foundations or\noverturned, large tree tops and branches snapped off,\nshallow-rooted trees knocked over, moving vehicles blown\noff roads, and small boats pulled from moorings.\n\n* FOR MORE INFORMATION:\n- http://www.weather.gov/jax/",

Prepare for considerable wind\ndamage.\n- ACT: Move to safe shelter before the wind becomes hazardous.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Extensive\n- Considerable roof damage to sturdy buildings, with some\nhaving window, door, and garage door failures leading to\nstructural damage. Mobile homes severely damaged, with some\ndestroyed. Damage accentuated by airborne projectiles.\nLocations may be uninhabitable for weeks.\n- Many large trees snapped or uprooted along with fences and\nroadway signs blown over.\n- Some roads impassable from large debris, and more within\nurban or heavily wooded places. Several bridges, causeways,\nand access routes impassable.\n- Large areas with power and communications outages.\n\n* STORM SURGE\n- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST: Life-threatening storm surge possible\n- Peak Storm Surge Inundation: The potential for 4-7 feet\nabove ground somewhere within surge prone areas\n- Window of concern: through Friday morning\n\n- POTENTIAL THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY: Potential for storm\nsurge flooding greater than 6 feet above ground\n- The storm surge threat has remained nearly steady from the\nprevious assessment.\n- PLAN: Shelter against life-threatening storm surge flooding\nof greater than 6 feet above ground.\n- PREPARE: All ordered evacuations should be complete.\nEvacuees should be in shelters well away from storm surge\nflooding.\n- ACT: Remain sheltered in a safe location. Do not venture\noutside. Move to upper floors to escape rising water if\nnecessary.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Unfolding\n- Potential impacts from the main surge event are unfolding.\n\n* FLOODING RAIN\n- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST:\n- Peak Rainfall Amounts: Additional 4-8 inches, with locally\nhigher amounts\n\n- POTENTIAL THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY: Potential for localized\nflooding rain\n- The flooding rain threat has decreased from the previous\nassessment.\n- PLAN: Emergency plans should include the potential for\nlocalized flooding from heavy rain.\n- PREPARE: Consider protective actions if you are in an area\nvulnerable to flooding.\n- ACT: Heed any flood watches and warnings.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Limited\n- Localized rainfall flooding may prompt a few evacuations.\n- Rivers and tributaries may quickly rise with swifter\ncurrents. Small streams, creeks, canals, and ditches may\nbecome swollen and overflow in spots.\n- Flood waters can enter a few structures, especially in\nusually vulnerable spots. A few places where rapid ponding\nof water occurs at underpasses, low-lying spots, and poor\ndrainage areas. Several storm drains and retention ponds\nbecome near-full and begin to overflow. Some brief road and\nbridge closures.\n\n* TORNADO\n- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST:\n- Situation is somewhat favorable for tornadoes\n\n- POTENTIAL THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY: Potential for a few\ntornadoes\n- The tornado threat has increased from the previous\nassessment.\n- PLAN: Emergency plans should include the potential for a\nfew tornadoes.\n- PREPARE: If your shelter is particularly vulnerable to\ntornadoes, prepare to relocate to safe shelter before\nhazardous weather arrives.\n- ACT: If a tornado warning is issued, be ready to shelter\nquickly.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Limited\n- The occurrence of isolated tornadoes can hinder the\nexecution of emergency plans during tropical events.\n- A few places may experience tornado damage, along with\npower and communications disruptions.\n- Locations could realize roofs peeled off buildings,\nchimneys toppled, mobile homes pushed off foundations or\noverturned, large tree tops and branches snapped off,\nshallow-rooted trees knocked over, moving vehicles blown\noff roads, and small boats pulled from moorings.\n\n* FOR MORE INFORMATION:\n- http://www.weather.gov/jax/",

Prepare for considerable wind\ndamage.\n- ACT: Move to safe shelter before the wind becomes hazardous.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Extensive\n- Considerable roof damage to sturdy buildings, with some\nhaving window, door, and garage door failures leading to\nstructural damage. Mobile homes severely damaged, with some\ndestroyed. Damage accentuated by airborne projectiles.\nLocations may be uninhabitable for weeks.\n- Many large trees snapped or uprooted along with fences and\nroadway signs blown over.\n- Some roads impassable from large debris, and more within\nurban or heavily wooded places. Several bridges, causeways,\nand access routes impassable.\n- Large areas with power and communications outages.\n\n* STORM SURGE\n- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST: Life-threatening storm surge possible\n- Peak Storm Surge Inundation: The potential for 4-7 feet\nabove ground somewhere within surge prone areas\n- Window of concern: through Friday morning\n\n- POTENTIAL THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY: Potential for storm\nsurge flooding greater than 6 feet above ground\n- The storm surge threat has remained nearly steady from the\nprevious assessment.\n- PLAN: Shelter against life-threatening storm surge flooding\nof greater than 6 feet above ground.\n- PREPARE: All ordered evacuations should be complete.\nEvacuees should be in shelters well away from storm surge\nflooding.\n- ACT: Remain sheltered in a safe location. Do not venture\noutside.

Prepare for\nsignificant wind damage.\n- ACT: Move to safe shelter before the wind becomes hazardous.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Significant\n- Some damage to roofing and siding materials, along with\ndamage to porches, awnings, carports, and sheds. A few\nbuildings experiencing window, door, and garage door\nfailures. Mobile homes damaged, especially if unanchored.\nUnsecured lightweight objects become dangerous projectiles.\n- Several large trees snapped or uprooted, but with greater\nnumbers in places where trees are shallow rooted. Several\nfences and roadway signs blown over.\n- Some roads impassable from large debris, and more within\nurban or heavily wooded places. A few bridges, causeways,\nand access routes impassable.\n- Scattered power and communications outages, but more\nprevalent in areas with above ground lines.\n\n* STORM SURGE\n- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST: Life-threatening storm surge possible\n- Peak Storm Surge Inundation: The potential for 4-7 feet\nabove ground somewhere within surge prone areas\n- Window of concern: Begins early this morning\n\n- POTENTIAL THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY: Potential for storm\nsurge flooding greater than 6 feet above ground\n- The storm surge threat has remained nearly steady from the\nprevious assessment.\n- PLAN: Plan for life-threatening storm surge flooding of\ngreater than 6 feet above ground.\n- PREPARE: Evacuation efforts should soon be brought to\ncompletion before driving conditions become unsafe.\n- ACT: Leave immediately if evacuation orders are given for\nyour area to avoid being cut off from emergency services or\nneedlessly risk lives.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Extensive\n- Large areas of deep inundation with storm surge flooding\naccentuated by battering waves. Structural damage to\nbuildings, with several washing away. Damage compounded by\nfloating debris. Locations may be uninhabitable for an\nextended period.\n- Large sections of near-shore escape routes and secondary\nroads washed out or severely flooded. Flood control systems\nand barriers may become stressed.\n- Severe beach erosion with significant dune loss.\n- Major damage to marinas, docks, boardwalks, and piers.

Prepare for\nsignificant wind damage.\n- ACT: Move to safe shelter before the wind becomes hazardous.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Significant\n- Some damage to roofing and siding materials, along with\ndamage to porches, awnings, carports, and sheds. A few\nbuildings experiencing window, door, and garage door\nfailures. Mobile homes damaged, especially if unanchored.\nUnsecured lightweight objects become dangerous projectiles.\n- Several large trees snapped or uprooted, but with greater\nnumbers in places where trees are shallow rooted. Several\nfences and roadway signs blown over.\n- Some roads impassable from large debris, and more within\nurban or heavily wooded places. A few bridges, causeways,\nand access routes impassable.\n- Scattered power and communications outages, but more\nprevalent in areas with above ground lines.\n\n* STORM SURGE\n- No storm surge inundation forecast\n\n- POTENTIAL THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY: Little to no storm surge\nflooding\n- The storm surge threat has remained nearly steady from the\nprevious assessment.\n- PLAN: There is little to no threat of storm surge flooding.\nRough surf, coastal erosion, and life-threatening rip\ncurrents are possible.\n- PREPARE: Little to no preparations for storm surge flooding\nare needed.\n- ACT: Follow the instructions of local officials. Monitor\nforecasts.\n\n- REALIZED IMPACTS: Being Assessed\n- Little to no additional surge impacts expected. Community\nofficials are now assessing the extent of actual surge\nimpacts accordingly.\n\n* FLOODING RAIN\n- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST:\n- Peak Rainfall Amounts: Additional 3-6 inches, with locally\nhigher amounts\n\n- POTENTIAL THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY: Potential for localized\nflooding rain\n- The flooding rain threat has remained nearly steady from\nthe previous assessment.\n- PLAN: Emergency plans should include the potential for\nlocalized flooding from heavy rain.\n- PREPARE: Consider protective actions if you are in an area\nvulnerable to flooding.\n- ACT: Heed any flood watches and warnings.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Limited\n- Localized rainfall flooding may prompt a few evacuations.\n- Rivers and tributaries may quickly rise with swifter\ncurrents. Small streams, creeks, canals, and ditches may\nbecome swollen and overflow in spots.\n- Flood waters can enter a few structures, especially in\nusually vulnerable spots. A few places where rapid ponding\nof water occurs at underpasses, low-lying spots, and poor\ndrainage areas. Several storm drains and retention ponds\nbecome near-full and begin to overflow. Some brief road and\nbridge closures.\n\n* TORNADO\n- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST:\n- Situation is unfavorable for tornadoes\n\n- POTENTIAL THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY: Tornadoes not expected\n- The tornado threat has remained nearly steady from the\nprevious assessment.\n- PLAN: Tornadoes are not expected.

Prepare for\nsignificant wind damage.\n- ACT: Move to safe shelter before the wind becomes hazardous.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Significant\n- Some damage to roofing and siding materials, along with\ndamage to porches, awnings, carports, and sheds. A few\nbuildings experiencing window, door, and garage door\nfailures. Mobile homes damaged, especially if unanchored.\nUnsecured lightweight objects become dangerous projectiles.\n- Several large trees snapped or uprooted, but with greater\nnumbers in places where trees are shallow rooted. Several\nfences and roadway signs blown over.\n- Some roads impassable from large debris, and more within\nurban or heavily wooded places. A few bridges, causeways,\nand access routes impassable.\n- Scattered power and communications outages, but more\nprevalent in areas with above ground lines.\n\n* STORM SURGE\n- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST: Life-threatening storm surge possible\n- Peak Storm Surge Inundation: The potential for 4-7 feet\nabove ground somewhere within surge prone areas\n- Window of concern: Begins early this morning\n\n- POTENTIAL THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY: Potential for storm\nsurge flooding greater than 6 feet above ground\n- The storm surge threat has remained nearly steady from the\nprevious assessment.\n- PLAN: Plan for life-threatening storm surge flooding of\ngreater than 6 feet above ground.\n- PREPARE: Evacuation efforts should soon be brought to\ncompletion before driving conditions become unsafe.\n- ACT: Leave immediately if evacuation orders are given for\nyour area to avoid being cut off from emergency services or\nneedlessly risk lives.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Extensive\n- Large areas of deep inundation with storm surge flooding\naccentuated by battering waves. Structural damage to\nbuildings, with several washing away. Damage compounded by\nfloating debris. Locations may be uninhabitable for an\nextended period.\n- Large sections of near-shore escape routes and secondary\nroads washed out or severely flooded. Flood control systems\nand barriers may become stressed.\n- Severe beach erosion with significant dune loss.\n- Major damage to marinas, docks, boardwalks, and piers. Many\nsmall craft broken away from moorings, especially in\nunprotected anchorages with some lifted onshore and\nstranded.\n\n* FLOODING RAIN\n- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST:\n- Peak Rainfall Amounts: Additional 4-8 inches, with locally\nhigher amounts\n\n- POTENTIAL THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY: Potential for moderate\nflooding rain\n- The flooding rain threat has remained nearly steady from\nthe previous assessment.\n- PLAN: Emergency plans should include the potential for\nmoderate flooding from heavy rain. Evacuations and rescues\nare possible.\n- PREPARE: Consider protective actions if you are in an area\nvulnerable to flooding.\n- ACT: Heed any flood watches and warnings. Failure to take\naction may result in serious injury or loss of life.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Significant\n- Moderate rainfall flooding may prompt several evacuations\nand rescues.\n- Rivers and tributaries may quickly become swollen with\nswifter currents and overspill their banks in a few places,\nespecially in usually vulnerable spots. Small streams,\ncreeks, canals, and ditches overflow.\n- Flood waters can enter some structures or weaken\nfoundations. Several places may experience expanded areas\nof rapid inundation at underpasses, low-lying spots, and\npoor drainage areas. Some streets and parking lots take on\nmoving water as storm drains and retention ponds overflow.\nDriving conditions become hazardous. Some road and bridge\nclosures.\n\n* TORNADO\n- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST:\n- Situation is somewhat favorable for tornadoes\n\n- POTENTIAL THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY: Potential for a few\ntornadoes\n- The tornado threat has increased from the previous\nassessment.\n- PLAN: Emergency plans should include the potential for a\nfew tornadoes.\n- PREPARE: If your shelter is particularly vulnerable to\ntornadoes, prepare to relocate to safe shelter before\nhazardous weather arrives.\n- ACT: If a tornado warning is issued, be ready to shelter\nquickly.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Limited\n- The occurrence of isolated tornadoes can hinder the\nexecution of emergency plans during tropical events.\n- A few places may experience tornado damage, along with\npower and communications disruptions.\n- Locations could realize roofs peeled off buildings,\nchimneys toppled, mobile homes pushed off foundations or\noverturned, large tree tops and branches snapped off,\nshallow-rooted trees knocked over, moving vehicles blown\noff roads, and small boats pulled from moorings.\n\n* FOR MORE INFORMATION:\n- http://www.weather.gov/jax/",

        "description": "A Tropical Storm Warning means tropical storm-force winds are\nexpected somewhere within this area within the next 36 hours\n\n* LOCATIONS AFFECTED\n- Jekyll Island\n- Glynn Haven\n- Sea Island\n- St. Simons\n- Country Club Estate\n- Dock Junction\n\n* WIND\n- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST: Below tropical storm force wind\n- Peak Wind Forecast: 25-35 mph with gusts to 55 mph\n\n- POTENTIAL THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY: Potential for wind 58 to\n73 mph\n- The wind threat has decreased from the previous assessment.\n- PLAN: Plan for dangerous wind of equivalent strong tropical\nstorm force due to possible forecast changes in track,\nsize, or intensity.\n- PREPARE: Remaining efforts to protect life and property\nshould be completed as soon as possible. Prepare for\nsignificant wind damage.\n- ACT: Move to safe shelter before the wind becomes hazardous.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Significant\n- Some damage to roofing and siding materials, along with\ndamage to porches, awnings, carports, and sheds. A few\nbuildings experiencing window, door, and garage door\nfailures. Mobile homes damaged, especially if unanchored.\nUnsecured lightweight objects become dangerous projectiles.\n- Several large trees snapped or uprooted, but with greater\nnumbers in places where trees are shallow rooted. Several\nfences and roadway signs blown over.\n- Some roads impassable from large debris, and more within\nurban or heavily wooded places. A few bridges, causeways,\nand access routes impassable.\n- Scattered power and communications outages, but more\nprevalent in areas with above ground lines.\n\n* STORM SURGE\n- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST: Life-threatening storm surge possible\n- Peak Storm Surge Inundation: The potential for 4-7 feet\nabove ground somewhere within surge prone areas\n- Window of concern: Begins early this morning\n\n- POTENTIAL THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY: Potential for storm\nsurge flooding greater than 6 feet above ground\n- The storm surge threat has remained nearly steady from the\nprevious assessment.\n- PLAN: Plan for life-threatening storm surge flooding of\ngreater than 6 feet above ground.\n- PREPARE: Evacuation efforts should soon be brought to\ncompletion before driving conditions become unsafe.\n- ACT: Leave immediately if evacuation orders are given for\nyour area to avoid being cut off from emergency services or\nneedlessly risk lives.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Extensive\n- Large areas of deep inundation with storm surge flooding\naccentuated by battering waves. Structural damage to\nbuildings, with several washing away. Damage compounded by\nfloating debris. Locations may be uninhabitable for an\nextended period.\n- Large sections of near-shore escape routes and secondary\nroads washed out or severely flooded. Flood control systems\nand barriers may become stressed.\n- Severe beach erosion with significant dune loss.\n- Major damage to marinas, docks, boardwalks, and piers. Many\nsmall craft broken away from moorings, especially in\nunprotected anchorages with some lifted onshore and\nstranded.\n\n* FLOODING RAIN\n- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST:\n- Peak Rainfall Amounts: Additional 4-8 inches, with locally\nhigher amounts\n\n- POTENTIAL THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY: Potential for moderate\nflooding rain\n- The flooding rain threat has remained nearly steady from\nthe previous assessment.\n- PLAN: Emergency plans should include the potential for\nmoderate flooding from heavy rain. Evacuations and rescues\nare possible.\n- PREPARE: Consider protective actions if you are in an area\nvulnerable to flooding.\n- ACT: Heed any flood watches and warnings. Failure to take\naction may result in serious injury or loss of life.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Significant\n- Moderate rainfall flooding may prompt several evacuations\nand rescues.\n- Rivers and tributaries may quickly become swollen with\nswifter currents and overspill their banks in a few places,\nespecially in usually vulnerable spots. Small streams,\ncreeks, canals, and ditches overflow.\n- Flood waters can enter some structures or weaken\nfoundations. Several places may experience expanded areas\nof rapid inundation at underpasses, low-lying spots, and\npoor drainage areas. Some streets and parking lots take on\nmoving water as storm drains and retention ponds overflow.\nDriving conditions become hazardous. Some road and bridge\nclosures.\n\n* TORNADO\n- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST:\n- Situation is somewhat favorable for tornadoes\n\n- POTENTIAL THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY: Potential for a few\ntornadoes\n- The tornado threat has increased from the previous\nassessment.\n- PLAN: Emergency plans should include the potential for a\nfew tornadoes.\n- PREPARE: If your shelter is particularly vulnerable to\ntornadoes, prepare to relocate to safe shelter before\nhazardous weather arrives.\n- ACT: If a tornado warning is issued, be ready to shelter\nquickly.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Limited\n- The occurrence of isolated tornadoes can hinder the\nexecution of emergency plans during tropical events.\n- A few places may experience tornado damage, along with\npower and communications disruptions.\n- Locations could realize roofs peeled off buildings,\nchimneys toppled, mobile homes pushed off foundations or\noverturned, large tree tops and branches snapped off,\nshallow-rooted trees knocked over, moving vehicles blown\noff roads, and small boats pulled from moorings.\n\n* FOR MORE INFORMATION:\n- http://www.weather.gov/jax/",

Prepare for considerable wind\ndamage.\n- ACT: Move to safe shelter before the wind becomes hazardous.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Extensive\n- Considerable roof damage to sturdy buildings, with some\nhaving window, door, and garage door failures leading to\nstructural damage. Mobile homes severely damaged, with some\ndestroyed. Damage accentuated by airborne projectiles.\nLocations may be uninhabitable for weeks.\n- Many large trees snapped or uprooted along with fences and\nroadway signs blown over.\n- Some roads impassable from large debris, and more within\nurban or heavily wooded places. Several bridges, causeways,\nand access routes impassable.\n- Large areas with power and communications outages.\n\n* STORM SURGE\n- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST: Life-threatening storm surge possible\n- Peak Storm Surge Inundation: The potential for 4-7 feet\nabove ground somewhere within surge prone areas\n- Window of concern: through Friday morning\n\n- POTENTIAL THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY: Potential for storm\nsurge flooding greater than 6 feet above ground\n- The storm surge threat has remained nearly steady from the\nprevious assessment.\n- PLAN: Shelter against life-threatening storm surge flooding\nof greater than 6 feet above ground.\n- PREPARE: All ordered evacuations should be complete.\nEvacuees should be in shelters well away from storm surge\nflooding.\n- ACT: Remain sheltered in a safe location. Do not venture\noutside. Move to upper floors to escape rising water if\nnecessary.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Unfolding\n- Potential impacts from the main surge event are unfolding.\n\n* FLOODING RAIN\n- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST:\n- Peak Rainfall Amounts: Additional 4-8 inches, with locally\nhigher amounts\n\n- POTENTIAL THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY: Potential for localized\nflooding rain\n- The flooding rain threat has decreased from the previous\nassessment.\n- PLAN: Emergency plans should include the potential for\nlocalized flooding from heavy rain.\n- PREPARE: Consider protective actions if you are in an area\nvulnerable to flooding.\n- ACT: Heed any flood watches and warnings.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Limited\n- Localized rainfall flooding may prompt a few evacuations.\n- Rivers and tributaries may quickly rise with swifter\ncurrents. Small streams, creeks, canals, and ditches may\nbecome swollen and overflow in spots.\n- Flood waters can enter a few structures, especially in\nusually vulnerable spots. A few places where rapid ponding\nof water occurs at underpasses, low-lying spots, and poor\ndrainage areas. Several storm drains and retention ponds\nbecome near-full and begin to overflow. Some brief road and\nbridge closures.\n\n* TORNADO\n- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST:\n- Situation is somewhat favorable for tornadoes\n\n- POTENTIAL THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY: Potential for a few\ntornadoes\n- The tornado threat has increased from the previous\nassessment.\n- PLAN: Emergency plans should include the potential for a\nfew tornadoes.\n- PREPARE: If your shelter is particularly vulnerable to\ntornadoes, prepare to relocate to safe shelter before\nhazardous weather arrives.\n- ACT: If a tornado warning is issued, be ready to shelter\nquickly.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Limited\n- The occurrence of isolated tornadoes can hinder the\nexecution of emergency plans during tropical events.\n- A few places may experience tornado damage, along with\npower and communications disruptions.\n- Locations could realize roofs peeled off buildings,\nchimneys toppled, mobile homes pushed off foundations or\noverturned, large tree tops and branches snapped off,\nshallow-rooted trees knocked over, moving vehicles blown\noff roads, and small boats pulled from moorings.\n\n* FOR MORE INFORMATION:\n- http://www.weather.gov/jax/",

Prepare for\nsignificant wind damage.\n- ACT: Move to safe shelter before the wind becomes hazardous.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Significant\n- Some damage to roofing and siding materials, along with\ndamage to porches, awnings, carports, and sheds. A few\nbuildings experiencing window, door, and garage door\nfailures. Mobile homes damaged, especially if unanchored.\nUnsecured lightweight objects become dangerous projectiles.\n- Several large trees snapped or uprooted, but with greater\nnumbers in places where trees are shallow rooted. Several\nfences and roadway signs blown over.\n- Some roads impassable from large debris, and more within\nurban or heavily wooded places. A few bridges, causeways,\nand access routes impassable.\n- Scattered power and communications outages, but more\nprevalent in areas with above ground lines.\n\n* STORM SURGE\n- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST: Life-threatening storm surge possible\n- Peak Storm Surge Inundation: The potential for 4-7 feet\nabove ground somewhere within surge prone areas\n- Window of concern: Begins early this morning\n\n- POTENTIAL THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY: Potential for storm\nsurge flooding greater than 6 feet above ground\n- The storm surge threat has remained nearly steady from the\nprevious assessment.\n- PLAN: Plan for life-threatening storm surge flooding of\ngreater than 6 feet above ground.\n- PREPARE: Evacuation efforts should soon be brought to\ncompletion before driving conditions become unsafe.\n- ACT: Leave immediately if evacuation orders are given for\nyour area to avoid being cut off from emergency services or\nneedlessly risk lives.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Extensive\n- Large areas of deep inundation with storm surge flooding\naccentuated by battering waves. Structural damage to\nbuildings, with several washing away. Damage compounded by\nfloating debris. Locations may be uninhabitable for an\nextended period.\n- Large sections of near-shore escape routes and secondary\nroads washed out or severely flooded. Flood control systems\nand barriers may become stressed.\n- Severe beach erosion with significant dune loss.\n- Major damage to marinas, docks, boardwalks, and piers. Many\nsmall craft broken away from moorings, especially in\nunprotected anchorages with some lifted onshore and\nstranded.\n\n* FLOODING RAIN\n- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST:\n- Peak Rainfall Amounts: Additional 4-8 inches, with locally\nhigher amounts\n\n- POTENTIAL THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY: Potential for moderate\nflooding rain\n- The flooding rain threat has remained nearly steady from\nthe previous assessment.\n- PLAN: Emergency plans should include the potential for\nmoderate flooding from heavy rain. Evacuations and rescues\nare possible.\n- PREPARE: Consider protective actions if you are in an area\nvulnerable to flooding.\n- ACT: Heed any flood watches and warnings. Failure to take\naction may result in serious injury or loss of life.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Significant\n- Moderate rainfall flooding may prompt several evacuations\nand rescues.\n- Rivers and tributaries may quickly become swollen with\nswifter currents and overspill their banks in a few places,\nespecially in usually vulnerable spots. Small streams,\ncreeks, canals, and ditches overflow.\n- Flood waters can enter some structures or weaken\nfoundations. Several places may experience expanded areas\nof rapid inundation at underpasses, low-lying spots, and\npoor drainage areas. Some streets and parking lots take on\nmoving water as storm drains and retention ponds overflow.\nDriving conditions become hazardous. Some road and bridge\nclosures.\n\n* TORNADO\n- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST:\n- Situation is somewhat favorable for tornadoes\n\n- POTENTIAL THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY: Potential for a few\ntornadoes\n- The tornado threat has increased from the previous\nassessment.\n- PLAN: Emergency plans should include the potential for a\nfew tornadoes.\n- PREPARE: If your shelter is particularly vulnerable to\ntornadoes, prepare to relocate to safe shelter before\nhazardous weather arrives.\n- ACT: If a tornado warning is issued, be ready to shelter\nquickly.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Limited\n- The occurrence of isolated tornadoes can hinder the\nexecution of emergency plans during tropical events.\n- A few places may experience tornado damage, along with\npower and communications disruptions.\n- Locations could realize roofs peeled off buildings,\nchimneys toppled, mobile homes pushed off foundations or\noverturned, large tree tops and branches snapped off,\nshallow-rooted trees knocked over, moving vehicles blown\noff roads, and small boats pulled from moorings.\n\n* FOR MORE INFORMATION:\n- http://www.weather.gov/jax/",

Prepare for\nsignificant wind damage.\n- ACT: Move to safe shelter before the wind becomes hazardous.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Significant\n- Some damage to roofing and siding materials, along with\ndamage to porches, awnings, carports, and sheds. A few\nbuildings experiencing window, door, and garage door\nfailures. Mobile homes damaged, especially if unanchored.\nUnsecured lightweight objects become dangerous projectiles.\n- Several large trees snapped or uprooted, but with greater\nnumbers in places where trees are shallow rooted. Several\nfences and roadway signs blown over.\n- Some roads impassable from large debris, and more within\nurban or heavily wooded places. A few bridges, causeways,\nand access routes impassable.\n- Scattered power and communications outages, but more\nprevalent in areas with above ground lines.\n\n* STORM SURGE\n- No storm surge inundation forecast\n\n- POTENTIAL THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY: Little to no storm surge\nflooding\n- The storm surge threat has remained nearly steady from the\nprevious assessment.\n- PLAN: The threat from storm surge is diminishing as flood\nwaters recede.\n- PREPARE: Heed instructions from local officials when moving\nabout. Do not enter flooded areas.\n- ACT: Exercise safety.\n\n- REALIZED IMPACTS: Being Assessed\n- Little to no additional surge impacts expected. Community\nofficials are now assessing the extent of actual surge\nimpacts accordingly.\n\n* FLOODING RAIN\n- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST:\n- Peak Rainfall Amounts: Additional 4-8 inches, with locally\nhigher amounts\n\n- POTENTIAL THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY: Potential for localized\nflooding rain\n- The flooding rain threat has remained nearly steady from\nthe previous assessment.\n- PLAN: Emergency plans should include the potential for\nlocalized flooding from heavy rain.\n- PREPARE: Consider protective actions if you are in an area\nvulnerable to flooding.\n- ACT: Heed any flood watches and warnings.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Limited\n- Localized rainfall flooding may prompt a few evacuations.\n- Rivers and tributaries may quickly rise with swifter\ncurrents. Small streams, creeks, canals, and ditches may\nbecome swollen and overflow in spots.\n- Flood waters can enter a few structures, especially in\nusually vulnerable spots. A few places where rapid ponding\nof water occurs at underpasses, low-lying spots, and poor\ndrainage areas. Several storm drains and retention ponds\nbecome near-full and begin to overflow. Some brief road and\nbridge closures.\n\n* TORNADO\n- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST:\n- Situation is somewhat favorable for tornadoes\n\n- POTENTIAL THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY: Potential for a few\ntornadoes\n- The tornado threat has increased from the previous\nassessment.\n- PLAN: Emergency plans should include the potential for a\nfew tornadoes.\n- PREPARE: If your shelter is particularly vulnerable to\ntornadoes, prepare to relocate to safe shelter before\nhazardous weather arrives.\n- ACT: If a tornado warning is issued, be ready to shelter\nquickly.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Limited\n- The occurrence of isolated tornadoes can hinder the\nexecution of emergency plans during tropical events.\n- A few places may experience tornado damage, along with\npower and communications disruptions.\n- Locations could realize roofs peeled off buildings,\nchimneys toppled, mobile homes pushed off foundations or\noverturned, large tree tops and branches snapped off,\nshallow-rooted trees knocked over, moving vehicles blown\noff roads, and small boats pulled from moorings.\n\n* FOR MORE INFORMATION:\n- http://www.weather.gov/jax/",

Prepare for\nsignificant wind damage.\n- ACT: Move to safe shelter before the wind becomes hazardous.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Significant\n- Some damage to roofing and siding materials, along with\ndamage to porches, awnings, carports, and sheds. A few\nbuildings experiencing window, door, and garage door\nfailures. Mobile homes damaged, especially if unanchored.\nUnsecured lightweight objects become dangerous projectiles.\n- Several large trees snapped or uprooted, but with greater\nnumbers in places where trees are shallow rooted. Several\nfences and roadway signs blown over.\n- Some roads impassable from large debris, and more within\nurban or heavily wooded places. A few bridges, causeways,\nand access routes impassable.\n- Scattered power and communications outages, but more\nprevalent in areas with above ground lines.\n\n* STORM SURGE\n- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST: Life-threatening storm surge possible\n- Peak Storm Surge Inundation: The potential for 4-7 feet\nabove ground somewhere within surge prone areas\n- Window of concern: Begins early this morning\n\n- POTENTIAL THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY: Potential for storm\nsurge flooding greater than 6 feet above ground\n- The storm surge threat has remained nearly steady from the\nprevious assessment.\n- PLAN: Plan for life-threatening storm surge flooding of\ngreater than 6 feet above ground.\n- PREPARE: Evacuation efforts should soon be brought to\ncompletion before driving conditions become unsafe.\n- ACT: Leave immediately if evacuation orders are given for\nyour area to avoid being cut off from emergency services or\nneedlessly risk lives.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Extensive\n- Large areas of deep inundation with storm surge flooding\naccentuated by battering waves. Structural damage to\nbuildings, with several washing away. Damage compounded by\nfloating debris. Locations may be uninhabitable for an\nextended period.\n- Large sections of near-shore escape routes and secondary\nroads washed out or severely flooded. Flood control systems\nand barriers may become stressed.\n- Severe beach erosion with significant dune loss.\n- Major damage to marinas, docks, boardwalks, and piers. Many\nsmall craft broken away from moorings, especially in\nunprotected anchorages with some lifted onshore and\nstranded.\n\n* FLOODING RAIN\n- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST:\n- Peak Rainfall Amounts: Additional 4-8 inches, with locally\nhigher amounts\n\n- POTENTIAL THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY: Potential for localized\nflooding rain\n- The flooding rain threat has decreased from the previous\nassessment.\n- PLAN: Emergency plans should include the potential for\nlocalized flooding from heavy rain.\n- PREPARE: Consider protective actions if you are in an area\nvulnerable to flooding.\n- ACT: Heed any flood watches and warnings.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Limited\n- Localized rainfall flooding may prompt a few evacuations.\n- Rivers and tributaries may quickly rise with swifter\ncurrents. Small streams, creeks, canals, and ditches may\nbecome swollen and overflow in spots.\n- Flood waters can enter a few structures, especially in\nusually vulnerable spots. A few places where rapid ponding\nof water occurs at underpasses, low-lying spots, and poor\ndrainage areas. Several storm drains and retention ponds\nbecome near-full and begin to overflow. Some brief road and\nbridge closures.\n\n* TORNADO\n- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST:\n- Situation is somewhat favorable for tornadoes\n\n- POTENTIAL THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY: Potential for a few\ntornadoes\n- The tornado threat has increased from the previous\nassessment.\n- PLAN: Emergency plans should include the potential for a\nfew tornadoes.\n- PREPARE: If your shelter is particularly vulnerable to\ntornadoes, prepare to relocate to safe shelter before\nhazardous weather arrives.\n- ACT: If a tornado warning is issued, be ready to shelter\nquickly.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Limited\n- The occurrence of isolated tornadoes can hinder the\nexecution of emergency plans during tropical events.\n- A few places may experience tornado damage, along with\npower and communications disruptions.\n- Locations could realize roofs peeled off buildings,\nchimneys toppled, mobile homes pushed off foundations or\noverturned, large tree tops and branches snapped off,\nshallow-rooted trees knocked over, moving vehicles blown\noff roads, and small boats pulled from moorings.\n\n* FOR MORE INFORMATION:\n- http://www.weather.gov/jax/",

Prepare for\nsignificant wind damage.\n- ACT: Move to safe shelter before the wind becomes hazardous.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Significant\n- Some damage to roofing and siding materials, along with\ndamage to porches, awnings, carports, and sheds. A few\nbuildings experiencing window, door, and garage door\nfailures. Mobile homes damaged, especially if unanchored.\nUnsecured lightweight objects become dangerous projectiles.\n- Several large trees snapped or uprooted, but with greater\nnumbers in places where trees are shallow rooted. Several\nfences and roadway signs blown over.\n- Some roads impassable from large debris, and more within\nurban or heavily wooded places. A few bridges, causeways,\nand access routes impassable.\n- Scattered power and communications outages, but more\nprevalent in areas with above ground lines.\n\n* STORM SURGE\n- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST: Life-threatening storm surge possible\n- Peak Storm Surge Inundation: The potential for 4-7 feet\nabove ground somewhere within surge prone areas\n- Window of concern: Begins early this morning\n\n- POTENTIAL THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY: Potential for storm\nsurge flooding greater than 6 feet above ground\n- The storm surge threat has remained nearly steady from the\nprevious assessment.\n- PLAN: Plan for life-threatening storm surge flooding of\ngreater than 6 feet above ground.\n- PREPARE: Evacuation preparations should be underway.\nAssemble disaster supplies and know your evacuation route.\n- ACT: Leave if evacuation orders are given for your area.\nFailure to heed evacuation orders may result in the loss of\nyour life.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Extensive\n- Large areas of deep inundation with storm surge flooding\naccentuated by battering waves. Structural damage to\nbuildings, with several washing away. Damage compounded by\nfloating debris. Locations may be uninhabitable for an\nextended period.\n- Large sections of near-shore escape routes and secondary\nroads washed out or severely flooded. Flood control systems\nand barriers may become stressed.\n- Severe beach erosion with significant dune loss.\n- Major damage to marinas, docks, boardwalks, and piers. Many\nsmall craft broken away from moorings, especially in\nunprotected anchorages with some lifted onshore and\nstranded.\n\n* FLOODING RAIN\n- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST:\n- Peak Rainfall Amounts: Additional 4-8 inches, with locally\nhigher amounts\n\n- POTENTIAL THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY: Potential for localized\nflooding rain\n- The flooding rain threat has decreased from the previous\nassessment.\n- PLAN: Emergency plans should include the potential for\nlocalized flooding from heavy rain.\n- PREPARE: Consider protective actions if you are in an area\nvulnerable to flooding.\n- ACT: Heed any flood watches and warnings.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Limited\n- Localized rainfall flooding may prompt a few evacuations.\n- Rivers and tributaries may quickly rise with swifter\ncurrents. Small streams, creeks, canals, and ditches may\nbecome swollen and overflow in spots.\n- Flood waters can enter a few structures, especially in\nusually vulnerable spots. A few places where rapid ponding\nof water occurs at underpasses, low-lying spots, and poor\ndrainage areas. Several storm drains and retention ponds\nbecome near-full and begin to overflow. Some brief road and\nbridge closures.\n\n* TORNADO\n- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST:\n- Situation is somewhat favorable for tornadoes\n\n- POTENTIAL THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY: Potential for a few\ntornadoes\n- The tornado threat has increased from the previous\nassessment.\n- PLAN: Emergency plans should include the potential for a\nfew tornadoes.\n- PREPARE: If your shelter is particularly vulnerable to\ntornadoes, prepare to relocate to safe shelter before\nhazardous weather arrives.\n- ACT: If a tornado warning is issued, be ready to shelter\nquickly.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Limited\n- The occurrence of isolated tornadoes can hinder the\nexecution of emergency plans during tropical events.\n- A few places may experience tornado damage, along with\npower and communications disruptions.\n- Locations could realize roofs peeled off buildings,\nchimneys toppled, mobile homes pushed off foundations or\noverturned, large tree tops and branches snapped off,\nshallow-rooted trees knocked over, moving vehicles blown\noff roads, and small boats pulled from moorings.\n\n* FOR MORE INFORMATION:\n- http://www.weather.gov/jax/",

Prepare for\nsignificant wind damage.\n- ACT: Move to safe shelter before the wind becomes hazardous.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Significant\n- Some damage to roofing and siding materials, along with\ndamage to porches, awnings, carports, and sheds. A few\nbuildings experiencing window, door, and garage door\nfailures. Mobile homes damaged, especially if unanchored.\nUnsecured lightweight objects become dangerous projectiles.\n- Several large trees snapped or uprooted, but with greater\nnumbers in places where trees are shallow rooted. Several\nfences and roadway signs blown over.\n- Some roads impassable from large debris, and more within\nurban or heavily wooded places. A few bridges, causeways,\nand access routes impassable.\n- Scattered power and communications outages, but more\nprevalent in areas with above ground lines.\n\n* STORM SURGE\n- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST: Life-threatening storm surge possible\n- Peak Storm Surge Inundation: The potential for 4-7 feet\nabove ground somewhere within surge prone areas\n- Window of concern: Begins early this morning\n\n- POTENTIAL THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY: Potential for storm\nsurge flooding greater than 6 feet above ground\n- The storm surge threat has remained nearly steady from the\nprevious assessment.\n- PLAN: Plan for life-threatening storm surge flooding of\ngreater than 6 feet above ground.\n- PREPARE: Evacuation efforts should soon be brought to\ncompletion before driving conditions become unsafe.\n- ACT: Leave immediately if evacuation orders are given for\nyour area to avoid being cut off from emergency services or\nneedlessly risk lives.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Extensive\n- Large areas of deep inundation with storm surge flooding\naccentuated by battering waves. Structural damage to\nbuildings, with several washing away. Damage compounded by\nfloating debris. Locations may be uninhabitable for an\nextended period.\n- Large sections of near-shore escape routes and secondary\nroads washed out or severely flooded. Flood control systems\nand barriers may become stressed.\n- Severe beach erosion with significant dune loss.\n- Major damage to marinas, docks, boardwalks, and piers. Many\nsmall craft broken away from moorings, especially in\nunprotected anchorages with some lifted onshore and\nstranded.\n\n* FLOODING RAIN\n- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST:\n- Peak Rainfall Amounts: Additional 4-8 inches, with locally\nhigher amounts\n\n- POTENTIAL THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY: Potential for localized\nflooding rain\n- The flooding rain threat has decreased from the previous\nassessment.\n- PLAN: Emergency plans should include the potential for\nlocalized flooding from heavy rain.\n- PREPARE: Consider protective actions if you are in an area\nvulnerable to flooding.\n- ACT: Heed any flood watches and warnings.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Limited\n- Localized rainfall flooding may prompt a few evacuations.\n- Rivers and tributaries may quickly rise with swifter\ncurrents.

Prepare for\nsignificant wind damage.\n- ACT: Move to safe shelter before the wind becomes hazardous.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Significant\n- Some damage to roofing and siding materials, along with\ndamage to porches, awnings, carports, and sheds. A few\nbuildings experiencing window, door, and garage door\nfailures. Mobile homes damaged, especially if unanchored.\nUnsecured lightweight objects become dangerous projectiles.\n- Several large trees snapped or uprooted, but with greater\nnumbers in places where trees are shallow rooted. Several\nfences and roadway signs blown over.\n- Some roads impassable from large debris, and more within\nurban or heavily wooded places. A few bridges, causeways,\nand access routes impassable.\n- Scattered power and communications outages, but more\nprevalent in areas with above ground lines.\n\n* STORM SURGE\n- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST: Life-threatening storm surge possible\n- Peak Storm Surge Inundation: The potential for 4-7 feet\nabove ground somewhere within surge prone areas\n- Window of concern: Begins early this morning\n\n- POTENTIAL THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY: Potential for storm\nsurge flooding greater than 6 feet above ground\n- The storm surge threat has remained nearly steady from the\nprevious assessment.\n- PLAN: Plan for life-threatening storm surge flooding of\ngreater than 6 feet above ground.\n- PREPARE: Evacuation efforts should soon be brought to\ncompletion before driving conditions become unsafe.\n- ACT: Leave immediately if evacuation orders are given for\nyour area to avoid being cut off from emergency services or\nneedlessly risk lives.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Extensive\n- Large areas of deep inundation with storm surge flooding\naccentuated by battering waves. Structural damage to\nbuildings, with several washing away. Damage compounded by\nfloating debris. Locations may be uninhabitable for an\nextended period.\n- Large sections of near-shore escape routes and secondary\nroads washed out or severely flooded. Flood control systems\nand barriers may become stressed.\n- Severe beach erosion with significant dune loss.\n- Major damage to marinas, docks, boardwalks, and piers. Many\nsmall craft broken away from moorings, especially in\nunprotected anchorages with some lifted onshore and\nstranded.\n\n* FLOODING RAIN\n- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST:\n- Peak Rainfall Amounts: Additional 4-8 inches, with locally\nhigher amounts\n\n- POTENTIAL THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY: Potential for localized\nflooding rain\n- The flooding rain threat has decreased from the previous\nassessment.\n- PLAN: Emergency plans should include the potential for\nlocalized flooding from heavy rain.\n- PREPARE: Consider protective actions if you are in an area\nvulnerable to flooding.\n- ACT: Heed any flood watches and warnings.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Limited\n- Localized rainfall flooding may prompt a few evacuations.\n- Rivers and tributaries may quickly rise with swifter\ncurrents. Small streams, creeks, canals, and ditches may\nbecome swollen and overflow in spots.\n- Flood waters can enter a few structures, especially in\nusually vulnerable spots. A few places where rapid ponding\nof water occurs at underpasses, low-lying spots, and poor\ndrainage areas. Several storm drains and retention ponds\nbecome near-full and begin to overflow. Some brief road and\nbridge closures.\n\n* TORNADO\n- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST:\n- Situation is somewhat favorable for tornadoes\n\n- POTENTIAL THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY: Potential for a few\ntornadoes\n- The tornado threat has increased from the previous\nassessment.\n- PLAN: Emergency plans should include the potential for a\nfew tornadoes.\n- PREPARE: If your shelter is particularly vulnerable to\ntornadoes, prepare to relocate to safe shelter before\nhazardous weather arrives.\n- ACT: If a tornado warning is issued, be ready to shelter\nquickly.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Limited\n- The occurrence of isolated tornadoes can hinder the\nexecution of emergency plans during tropical events.\n- A few places may experience tornado damage, along with\npower and communications disruptions.\n- Locations could realize roofs peeled off buildings,\nchimneys toppled, mobile homes pushed off foundations or\noverturned, large tree tops and branches snapped off,\nshallow-rooted trees knocked over, moving vehicles blown\noff roads, and small boats pulled from moorings.\n\n* FOR MORE INFORMATION:\n- http://www.weather.gov/jax/",

Prepare for\nsignificant wind damage.\n- ACT: Move to safe shelter before the wind becomes hazardous.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Significant\n- Some damage to roofing and siding materials, along with\ndamage to porches, awnings, carports, and sheds. A few\nbuildings experiencing window, door, and garage door\nfailures. Mobile homes damaged, especially if unanchored.\nUnsecured lightweight objects become dangerous projectiles.\n- Several large trees snapped or uprooted, but with greater\nnumbers in places where trees are shallow rooted. Several\nfences and roadway signs blown over.\n- Some roads impassable from large debris, and more within\nurban or heavily wooded places. A few bridges, causeways,\nand access routes impassable.\n- Scattered power and communications outages, but more\nprevalent in areas with above ground lines.\n\n* STORM SURGE\n- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST: Life-threatening storm surge possible\n- Peak Storm Surge Inundation: The potential for 4-7 feet\nabove ground somewhere within surge prone areas\n- Window of concern: Begins early this morning\n\n- POTENTIAL THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY: Potential for storm\nsurge flooding greater than 6 feet above ground\n- The storm surge threat has remained nearly steady from the\nprevious assessment.\n- PLAN: Plan for life-threatening storm surge flooding of\ngreater than 6 feet above ground.\n- PREPARE: Evacuation preparations should be underway.\nAssemble disaster supplies and know your evacuation route.\n- ACT: Leave if evacuation orders are given for your area.\nFailure to heed evacuation orders may result in the loss of\nyour life.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Extensive\n- Large areas of deep inundation with storm surge flooding\naccentuated by battering waves. Structural damage to\nbuildings, with several washing away. Damage compounded by\nfloating debris. Locations may be uninhabitable for an\nextended period.\n- Large sections of near-shore escape routes and secondary\nroads washed out or severely flooded. Flood control systems\nand barriers may become stressed.\n- Severe beach erosion with significant dune loss.\n- Major damage to marinas, docks, boardwalks, and piers. Many\nsmall craft broken away from moorings, especially in\nunprotected anchorages with some lifted onshore and\nstranded.\n\n* FLOODING RAIN\n- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST:\n- Peak Rainfall Amounts: Additional 4-8 inches, with locally\nhigher amounts\n\n- POTENTIAL THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY: Potential for localized\nflooding rain\n- The flooding rain threat has decreased from the previous\nassessment.\n- PLAN: Emergency plans should include the potential for\nlocalized flooding from heavy rain.\n- PREPARE: Consider protective actions if you are in an area\nvulnerable to flooding.\n- ACT: Heed any flood watches and warnings.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Limited\n- Localized rainfall flooding may prompt a few evacuations.\n- Rivers and tributaries may quickly rise with swifter\ncurrents. Small streams, creeks, canals, and ditches may\nbecome swollen and overflow in spots.\n- Flood waters can enter a few structures, especially in\nusually vulnerable spots. A few places where rapid ponding\nof water occurs at underpasses, low-lying spots, and poor\ndrainage areas. Several storm drains and retention ponds\nbecome near-full and begin to overflow. Some brief road and\nbridge closures.\n\n* TORNADO\n- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST:\n- Situation is somewhat favorable for tornadoes\n\n- POTENTIAL THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY: Potential for a few\ntornadoes\n- The tornado threat has increased from the previous\nassessment.\n- PLAN: Emergency plans should include the potential for a\nfew tornadoes.\n- PREPARE: If your shelter is particularly vulnerable to\ntornadoes, prepare to relocate to safe shelter before\nhazardous weather arrives.\n- ACT: If a tornado warning is issued, be ready to shelter\nquickly.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Limited\n- The occurrence of isolated tornadoes can hinder the\nexecution of emergency plans during tropical events.\n- A few places may experience tornado damage, along with\npower and communications disruptions.\n- Locations could realize roofs peeled off buildings,\nchimneys toppled, mobile homes pushed off foundations or\noverturned, large tree tops and branches snapped off,\nshallow-rooted trees knocked over, moving vehicles blown\noff roads, and small boats pulled from moorings.\n\n* FOR MORE INFORMATION:\n- http://www.weather.gov/jax/",

Prepare for\nsignificant wind damage.\n- ACT: Move to safe shelter before the wind becomes hazardous.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Significant\n- Some damage to roofing and siding materials, along with\ndamage to porches, awnings, carports, and sheds. A few\nbuildings experiencing window, door, and garage door\nfailures. Mobile homes damaged, especially if unanchored.\nUnsecured lightweight objects become dangerous projectiles.\n- Several large trees snapped or uprooted, but with greater\nnumbers in places where trees are shallow rooted. Several\nfences and roadway signs blown over.\n- Some roads impassable from large debris, and more within\nurban or heavily wooded places. A few bridges, causeways,\nand access routes impassable.\n- Scattered power and communications outages, but more\nprevalent in areas with above ground lines.\n\n* STORM SURGE\n- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST: Life-threatening storm surge possible\n- Peak Storm Surge Inundation: The potential for 4-7 feet\nabove ground somewhere within surge prone areas\n- Window of concern: Begins early this morning\n\n- POTENTIAL THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY: Potential for storm\nsurge flooding greater than 6 feet above ground\n- The storm surge threat has remained nearly steady from the\nprevious assessment.\n- PLAN: Plan for life-threatening storm surge flooding of\ngreater than 6 feet above ground.\n- PREPARE: Evacuation efforts should soon be brought to\ncompletion before driving conditions become unsafe.\n- ACT: Leave immediately if evacuation orders are given for\nyour area to avoid being cut off from emergency services or\nneedlessly risk lives.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Extensive\n- Large areas of deep inundation with storm surge flooding\naccentuated by battering waves. Structural damage to\nbuildings, with several washing away. Damage compounded by\nfloating debris. Locations may be uninhabitable for an\nextended period.\n- Large sections of near-shore escape routes and secondary\nroads washed out or severely flooded. Flood control systems\nand barriers may become stressed.\n- Severe beach erosion with significant dune loss.\n- Major damage to marinas, docks, boardwalks, and piers. Many\nsmall craft broken away from moorings, especially in\nunprotected anchorages with some lifted onshore and\nstranded.\n\n* FLOODING RAIN\n- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST:\n- Peak Rainfall Amounts: Additional 4-8 inches, with locally\nhigher amounts\n\n- POTENTIAL THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY: Potential for localized\nflooding rain\n- The flooding rain threat has decreased from the previous\nassessment.\n- PLAN: Emergency plans should include the potential for\nlocalized flooding from heavy rain.\n- PREPARE: Consider protective actions if you are in an area\nvulnerable to flooding.\n- ACT: Heed any flood watches and warnings.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Limited\n- Localized rainfall flooding may prompt a few evacuations.\n- Rivers and tributaries may quickly rise with swifter\ncurrents. Small streams, creeks, canals, and ditches may\nbecome swollen and overflow in spots.\n- Flood waters can enter a few structures, especially in\nusually vulnerable spots. A few places where rapid ponding\nof water occurs at underpasses, low-lying spots, and poor\ndrainage areas. Several storm drains and retention ponds\nbecome near-full and begin to overflow. Some brief road and\nbridge closures.\n\n* TORNADO\n- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST:\n- Situation is somewhat favorable for tornadoes\n\n- POTENTIAL THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY: Potential for a few\ntornadoes\n- The tornado threat has increased from the previous\nassessment.\n- PLAN: Emergency plans should include the potential for a\nfew tornadoes.\n- PREPARE: If your shelter is particularly vulnerable to\ntornadoes, prepare to relocate to safe shelter before\nhazardous weather arrives.\n- ACT: If a tornado warning is issued, be ready to shelter\nquickly.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Limited\n- The occurrence of isolated tornadoes can hinder the\nexecution of emergency plans during tropical events.\n- A few places may experience tornado damage, along with\npower and communications disruptions.\n- Locations could realize roofs peeled off buildings,\nchimneys toppled, mobile homes pushed off foundations or\noverturned, large tree tops and branches snapped off,\nshallow-rooted trees knocked over, moving vehicles blown\noff roads, and small boats pulled from moorings.\n\n* FOR MORE INFORMATION:\n- http://www.weather.gov/jax/",

Prepare for\nsignificant wind damage.\n- ACT: Move to safe shelter before the wind becomes hazardous.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Significant\n- Some damage to roofing and siding materials, along with\ndamage to porches, awnings, carports, and sheds. A few\nbuildings experiencing window, door, and garage door\nfailures. Mobile homes damaged, especially if unanchored.\nUnsecured lightweight objects become dangerous projectiles.\n- Several large trees snapped or uprooted, but with greater\nnumbers in places where trees are shallow rooted. Several\nfences and roadway signs blown over.\n- Some roads impassable from large debris, and more within\nurban or heavily wooded places. A few bridges, causeways,\nand access routes impassable.\n- Scattered power and communications outages, but more\nprevalent in areas with above ground lines.\n\n* STORM SURGE\n- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST: Life-threatening storm surge possible\n- Peak Storm Surge Inundation: The potential for 4-7 feet\nabove ground somewhere within surge prone areas\n- Window of concern: Begins early this morning\n\n- POTENTIAL THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY: Potential for storm\nsurge flooding greater than 6 feet above ground\n- The storm surge threat has remained nearly steady from the\nprevious assessment.\n- PLAN: Plan for life-threatening storm surge flooding of\ngreater than 6 feet above ground.\n- PREPARE: Evacuation efforts should soon be brought to\ncompletion before driving conditions become unsafe.\n- ACT: Leave immediately if evacuation orders are given for\nyour area to avoid being cut off from emergency services or\nneedlessly risk lives.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Extensive\n- Large areas of deep inundation with storm surge flooding\naccentuated by battering waves. Structural damage to\nbuildings, with several washing away. Damage compounded by\nfloating debris. Locations may be uninhabitable for an\nextended period.\n- Large sections of near-shore escape routes and secondary\nroads washed out or severely flooded. Flood control systems\nand barriers may become stressed.\n- Severe beach erosion with significant dune loss.\n- Major damage to marinas, docks, boardwalks, and piers. Many\nsmall craft broken away from moorings, especially in\nunprotected anchorages with some lifted onshore and\nstranded.\n\n* FLOODING RAIN\n- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST:\n- Peak Rainfall Amounts: Additional 4-8 inches, with locally\nhigher amounts\n\n- POTENTIAL THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY: Potential for localized\nflooding rain\n- The flooding rain threat has decreased from the previous\nassessment.\n- PLAN: Emergency plans should include the potential for\nlocalized flooding from heavy rain.\n- PREPARE: Consider protective actions if you are in an area\nvulnerable to flooding.\n- ACT: Heed any flood watches and warnings.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Limited\n- Localized rainfall flooding may prompt a few evacuations.\n- Rivers and tributaries may quickly rise with swifter\ncurrents. Small streams, creeks, canals, and ditches may\nbecome swollen and overflow in spots.\n- Flood waters can enter a few structures, especially in\nusually vulnerable spots. A few places where rapid ponding\nof water occurs at underpasses, low-lying spots, and poor\ndrainage areas. Several storm drains and retention ponds\nbecome near-full and begin to overflow. Some brief road and\nbridge closures.\n\n* TORNADO\n- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST:\n- Situation is somewhat favorable for tornadoes\n\n- POTENTIAL THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY: Potential for a few\ntornadoes\n- The tornado threat has increased from the previous\nassessment.\n- PLAN: Emergency plans should include the potential for a\nfew tornadoes.\n- PREPARE: If your shelter is particularly vulnerable to\ntornadoes, prepare to relocate to safe shelter before\nhazardous weather arrives.\n- ACT: If a tornado warning is issued, be ready to shelter\nquickly.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Limited\n- The occurrence of isolated tornadoes can hinder the\nexecution of emergency plans during tropical events.\n- A few places may experience tornado damage, along with\npower and communications disruptions.\n- Locations could realize roofs peeled off buildings,\nchimneys toppled, mobile homes pushed off foundations or\noverturned, large tree tops and branches snapped off,\nshallow-rooted trees knocked over, moving vehicles blown\noff roads, and small boats pulled from moorings.\n\n* FOR MORE INFORMATION:\n- http://www.weather.gov/jax/",

        "description": "...GALES OVER CENTRAL AND NORTHERN LAKE HURON...\n\n.Light and variable winds will veer to the southwest this morning and\nthen increase quickly by this afternoon as the pressure gradient\ntightens in advance of an approaching strong low pressure system and\ntrailing cold front. The strength of this low and a longer fetch of\nsoutherly wind will bring a time window for gales this afternoon\nover parts of central and northern portions of Lake Huron before\nadvancing warm air stabilizes conditions over the water. A strong\ncold front will then bring a line of strong to severe thunderstorms\nthis afternoon and evening which will add to the hazardous marine\nconditions. This front will be followed by a period of northwest\ngales tonight into Wednesday over the northern half of Lake Huron.\nThereafter, a broad area of high pressure will bring much improved\nmarine conditions by Wednesday night through late week.\n\nSmall Craft Advisories will continue for all nearshore waters from\nthis afternoon into Wednesday morning as strong south to southwest\nflow gusts to 30 knots later today and waves build within increased\nnorthwest flow overnight into Wednesday. A Gale Warning will also be\nissued for the central and northern open waters of Lake Huron. This\nwill be for both gusty southwesterly flow in advance of the cold\nfront and northwest gales in its wake later tonight into Wednesday.\nSaginaw Bay will also have to be watched for an upgrade to a warning\nas southwesterly flow may very well be enhanced up the bay for a\ntime from this afternoon into early evening.\n\n* WIND AND WAVES: During the Small Craft Advisory, expect\nsustained winds up to 23 knots from the northwest with gusts\nup to 31 knots. The largest expected significant waves will\nbe 7 feet with a potential maximum wave height of 10 feet.\n\n* TIMING: The maximum winds are expected around 5 AM EDT\nWednesday with the largest waves expected around 11 AM EDT\nWednesday.\n\nRefer to the latest marine forecasts for greater detail.",
        "instruction": "A Small Craft Advisory means that wind speeds of 21 to 33 knots\nare expected to produce hazardous wave conditions to small craft.\nInexperienced mariners...especially those operating smaller\nvessels should avoid navigating in these conditions.",

        "description": "This product covers southeast South Carolina and southeast Georgia\n\n**HURRICANE DORIAN EXPECTED TO IMPACT THE AREA WEDNESDAY THROUGH\nTHURSDAY**\n\nNEW INFORMATION\n---------------\n\n* CHANGES TO WATCHES AND WARNINGS:\n- None\n\n* CURRENT WATCHES AND WARNINGS:\n- A Tropical Storm Watch is in effect for Dorchester, Effingham,\nHampton, Inland Colleton, and Long\n- A Storm Surge Watch and Hurricane Watch are in effect for\nBeaufort, Charleston, Coastal Colleton, Coastal Jasper, and\nTidal Berkeley\n- A Storm Surge Warning and Hurricane Watch are in effect for\nCoastal Bryan, Coastal Chatham, Coastal Liberty, Coastal\nMcIntosh, and Inland McIntosh\n- A Hurricane Watch is in effect for Inland Berkeley, Inland\nBryan, Inland Chatham, Inland Jasper, and Inland Liberty\n\n* STORM INFORMATION:\n- About 410 miles south-southeast of Charleston SC or about 390\nmiles south-southeast of Savannah GA\n- 26.9N 78.4W\n- Storm Intensity 120 mph\n- Movement Stationary\n\nSITUATION OVERVIEW\n------------------\n\nDangerous Hurricane Dorian will move offshore of the Florida east\ncoast through Wednesday and offshore of the South Carolina and Georgia\ncoast Wednesday Night through Thursday. The hurricane will bring an\nincreased risk for strong winds, storm surge inundation, flash\nflooding, strong rip currents, and dangerous marine conditions to the\nregion.\n\nPOTENTIAL IMPACTS\n-----------------\n\n* SURGE:\nPrepare for life-threatening surge having possible extensive impacts\nacross across the coastal counties of Southeast South Carolina and\nSoutheast Georgia.\n\nPotential impacts in this area include:\n- Large areas of deep inundation of saltwater along immediate\nshorelines and in low-lying spots farther inland near rivers\nand creeks, with storm surge flooding accentuated by battering\nwaves. Structural damage to buildings, with several washing\naway. Damage compounded by floating debris. Locations may be\nuninhabitable for an extended period.\n- Large sections of near-shore escape routes and secondary roads\nwashed out or flooded and impassable. Flood control systems and\nbarriers could become stressed.\n- Severe beach erosion with significant dune loss.\n- Major damage to marinas, docks, boardwalks, and piers. Many\nsmall craft broken away from moorings, especially in\nunprotected anchorages, with some lifted onshore and stranded.\n- Drinking water and sewer services negatively impacted.\n- Hazardous containers and materials possibly present in surge\nwaters.\n\nElsewhere across southeast South Carolina and southeast Georgia,\nlittle to no impact is anticipated.\n\n* WIND:\nPrepare for life-threatening wind having possible extensive impacts for\nareas roughly along and east of Interstate 95. Potential impacts in\nthis area include:\n- Considerable roof damage to sturdy buildings, with some window,\ndoor, and garage door failures leading to structural damage.\nMobile homes severely damaged, with some destroyed. Damage\naccentuated by airborne projectiles. Some locations may be\nuninhabitable for weeks.\n- Danger of death or injury from falling objects and airborne\nprojectiles outside.\n- Large trees snapped or uprooted.\n- Some roads impassable from large debris, and more within urban\nor heavily wooded locations. Several bridges and access routes\nimpassable.\n- Large areas with power and communications outages, which could\npersist for days.\n- Several secured small craft could break free from moorings.\n\nAlso, prepare for dangerous wind having possible limited to\nsignificant impacts across interior Southeast South Carolina and\nSoutheast Georgia.\n\n* FLOODING RAIN:\nPrepare for dangerous rainfall flooding having possible significant\nimpacts across coastal areas of Southeast South Carolina and Southeast\nGeorgia. Potential impacts include:\n- Moderate rainfall flooding could prompt some rescues.\n- Rivers and tributaries could quickly become swollen with\nswifter currents and overspill their banks in a few places,\nespecially in normally vulnerable spots. Small streams, creeks,\ncanals, and ditches overflow.\n- Flood waters can enter some structures or weaken foundations.\nSeveral places could experience expanded areas of rapid\ninundation at underpasses, low-lying spots, and poor drainage\nareas. Some streets and parking lots take on moving water as\nstorm drains and retention ponds overflow. Driving conditions\nbecome hazardous. Some road and bridge closures.\n\nPrepare for locally hazardous rainfall flooding having possible\nlimited impacts across interior Southeast South Carolina and Southeast\nGeorgia.\n\n* TORNADOES:\nPrepare for a tornado event having possible limited impacts across\nmainly coastal South Carolina. Potential impacts include:\n- Isolated tornadoes can hinder the execution of emergency plans.\n- Isolated locations could experience tornado damage, along with\npower and communications disruptions.\n- In isolated locations, tornadoes could damage trees, vehicles,\nboats and buildings, especially mobile homes and other poorly\nconstructed structures.\n\nElsewhere across southeast South Carolina and southeast Georgia,\nlittle to no impact is anticipated.\n\n* OTHER COASTAL HAZARDS:\nSevere beach erosion, high surf, and strong rip currents will occur\nacross the beaches of Southeast South Carolina and Southeast Georgia.",
        "instruction": "* EVACUATIONS:\nListen to local official for recommended preparedness actions,\nincluding possible evacuation. If ordered to evacuate, do so\nimmediately.\n\nFor those not under evacuation orders, assess the risk from wind,\nfalling trees, and flooding at your location. If you decide to move,\nrelocate to a safer location nearby. If you do not relocate, help keep\nroadways open for those under evacuation orders.\n\nIf evacuating, follow designated evacuation routes. Seek traffic\ninformation on roadway signs, the radio, and from official sources.\n\n* OTHER PREPAREDNESS INFORMATION:\nWhen making safety and preparedness decisions, do not focus on the\nexact forecast track since hazards such as flooding rain, damaging wind\ngusts, storm surge, and tornadoes extend well away from the center of\nthe storm.\n\nIf you live in a place particularly vulnerable to flooding, such as\nnear the ocean or a large inland lake, in a low-lying or poor\ndrainage area, in a valley, or near an already swollen river, plan to\nmove to safe shelter on higher ground.\n\nIf you are a visitor, know the name of the county or parish in which\nyou are located and where it is relative to current watches and\nwarnings. If staying at a hotel, ask the management staff about their\nonsite disaster plan. Listen for evacuation orders, especially\npertaining to area visitors.\n\n* ADDITIONAL SOURCES OF INFORMATION:\n- For information on appropriate preparations see ready.gov\n- For information on creating an emergency plan see getagameplan.org\n- For additional disaster preparedness information see redcross.org",

        "description": "This product covers EAST CENTRAL FLORIDA\n\n**Category 4 Hurricane Dorian Continues Nearly Stationary Near Grand\nBahama Island**\n\nNEW INFORMATION\n---------------\n\n* CHANGES TO WATCHES AND WARNINGS:\n- None\n\n* CURRENT WATCHES AND WARNINGS:\n- A Storm Surge Warning and Hurricane Warning are in effect for\nCoastal Volusia, Indian River, Martin, Northern Brevard,\nSouthern Brevard, and St. Lucie\n- A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for Inland Volusia,\nNorthern Lake, Okeechobee, Orange, Osceola, Seminole, and\nSouthern Lake\n\n* STORM INFORMATION:\n- About 160 miles southeast of Cape Canaveral FL or about 110\nmiles east of Stuart FL\n- 26.9N 78.5W\n- Storm Intensity 130 mph\n- Movement Stationary\n\nSITUATION OVERVIEW\n------------------\n\nPowerful Hurricane Dorian remains nearly stationary just north of\nGrand Bahama Island, about 115 miles east-southeast of Stuart in Martin\nCounty. Dorian is expected to resume a slow northwestward motion\novernight, then turn north-northwest and move parallel to the east\ncoast of central Florida at a slightly faster forward speed Tuesday\ninto early Wednesday.\n\nSignificant coastal impacts from Dorian are being felt in Martin,\nSaint Lucie, Indian River, and Brevard Counties and will spread soon\ninto Volusia County. Weather conditions will steadily deteriorate\nacross all of east central Florida, and especially along the coast, as\nDorian makes its closest approach to the area.\n\nThere will be considerable impacts and damage to coastal areas, with\nat least some effects felt inland as well! The threat for damaging\nwinds and life-threatening storm surge remains high. Severe beach\nerosion and topping or breaching of the dunes from water runup during\nhigh tide, coupled with storm surge is a near certainty!\n\nWhile the latest forecast keeps the eye of Dorian offshore by about\n50 to 60 miles, even a slight deviation west of the forecast track\nwould bring stronger winds, even higher seas and surf, and heavier\nrain to the Florida east coast.\n\nStrong tropical storm force winds between 40 and 55 mph, with gusts to\nhurricane force, will spread north into Martin and Saint Lucie\nCounties overnight, spread farther north into Indian River County\nduring the pre-dawn hours, and then across Brevard and coastal Volusia\nCounties Tuesday through Tuesday night.\n\nThe threat for damaging winds is high for the coastal counties!\nPreparations for Dorian should have been completed. Persons along the\ncoast, especially those in Martin, Saint Lucie and Indian River\nCounties, will need to remain in shelter until conditions improve on\nWednesday. Father north in southern Brevard County, sheltering in\nplace will need to commence sometime on Tuesday. Residents of north\nBrevard and Volusia Counties will have a few hours, mainly during the\nmorning for some last-minute safety preparations.\n\nInland communities will also have an increasing threat for sustained\nwinds near tropical storm force, with higher gusts in squalls,\nespecially in eastern Okeechobee, Osceola, Orange and Seminole\nCounties, as well as inland Volusia County. These strong winds will\nreach Okeechobee and Osceola Counties beginning early Tuesday morning,\nand farther north winds to near tropical storm force will begin Tuesday\nafternoon. This will be a long duration event, with the worst\nconditions lasting 18 to 24 hours!\n\nThe threat for life-threatening storm surge also remains high, and\nsevere erosion of the beaches and dune lines is a near certainty! The\ncombination of surge and high astronomical tides will cause severe\nrunup of waves and water, resulting in inundation of many coastal\nlocations. Surge may reach 4 to 7 feet above ground near the coast.\nThe surge of north winds as the hurricane moves parallel to the coast\nwill cause water to pile up on the Intracoastal Waterway with coastal\nflooding possible in low lying areas along the river.\n\nLarge battering waves and higher than normal tides on top of the surge\nwill add to the destructive force of the water during several high\ntide cycles. Entering the water can be deadly as there will be very\nlarge breaking waves building in excess of 10 feet, in addition to\nnumerous strong rip currents.\n\nA high tide cycle is currently ongoing, and the next 3 high tide\ncycles will occur Tuesday between 1145 AM and noon, Wednesday around\nmidnight, and again in the early afternoon between 1245 and 100 PM.\n\nHeavy rainfall is forecast over east central Florida from Dorian, with\ntotal amounts of 4 to 8 inches over the coastal counties and 3 to 6\ninches inland, with maximum isolated rainfall amounts up to 10 inches\nalong the coast. While flooding will be possible inland, it will be\nmuch more likely near the coast in urban and poorly drained, low lying\nareas. Flooding and high water levels on area rivers such as the Saint\nJohns River will be aggravated by any additional rainfall, resulting in\nadditional rises on the river.\n\nWhile threat remains low, isolated tornadoes will be possible in\nsqualls as they move onshore along the coast this evening through\n\n\nPOTENTIAL IMPACTS\n-----------------\n\n* SURGE:\nProtect against life-threatening surge having possible extensive\nimpacts from Flagler Beach to Jupiter Inlet.\n\nIncreasing impacts in this area include:\n- Large areas of deep inundation with storm surge flooding\naccentuated by battering waves. Structural damage to buildings,\nwith several washing away. Damage compounded by floating\ndebris. Locations may be uninhabitable for an extended period.\n- Large sections of near-shore escape routes and secondary roads\nwashed out or severely flooded. Flood control systems and\nbarriers may become stressed.\n- Severe beach erosion with significant dune loss.\n- Major damage to marinas, docks, boardwalks, and piers. Many\nsmall craft broken away from moorings, especially in\nunprotected anchorages with some lifted onshore and stranded.\n\n\n* WIND:\nProtect against life-threatening wind having possible extensive impacts\nover the coastal counties of Volusia, Brevard, Indian River, Saint\nLucie and Martin.\n\nIncreasing impacts in this area include:\n- Considerable roof damage to sturdy buildings, with some having\nwindow, door, and garage door failures leading to structural\ndamage. Mobile homes severely damaged, with some destroyed.\nDamage accentuated by airborne projectiles. Locations may be\nuninhabitable for weeks.\n- Many large trees snapped or uprooted along with fences and\nroadway signs blown over.\n- Some roads impassable from large debris, and more within urban\nor heavily wooded places. Several bridges, causeways, and\naccess routes impassable.\n- Large areas with power and communications outages.\n\nAlso, protect against dangerous wind having possible limited to\nsignificant impacts across the interior counties of Lake, Seminole,\nOrange, Osceola, and Okeechobee. Move any unsecured objects inside.\n\n* FLOODING RAIN:\nProtect against dangerous rainfall flooding having possible significant\nimpacts across all of east central Florida, but particularly over areas\nnear the coast.\n\nPotential impacts include:\n- Heavy rainfall flooding may prompt several evacuations and\nrescues.\n- Rivers and tributaries may quickly become swollen with swifter\ncurrents and overspill their banks in a few places, especially\nin usually vulnerable spots. Small streams, creeks, canals,\narroyos, and ditches overflow.\n- Flood waters can enter some structures or weaken foundations.\nSeveral places may experience expanded areas of rapid\ninundation at underpasses, low-lying spots, and poor drainage\nareas. Some streets and parking lots take on moving water as\nstorm drains and retention ponds overflow. Driving conditions\nbecome hazardous. Some road and bridge closures.\n\nProtect against locally hazardous rainfall flooding having possible\nlimited impacts across the interior, especially in urban and poorly\ndrained low lying areas.\n\n* TORNADOES:\nProtect against a tornado event having possible limited impacts along\nthe coast. Potential impacts include:\n- The occurrence of isolated tornadoes can hinder the execution\nof emergency plans during tropical events.\n- A few places may experience tornado damage, along with power\nand communications disruptions.\n- Locations could realize roofs peeled off buildings, chimneys\ntoppled, mobile homes pushed off foundations or overturned,\nlarge tree tops and branches snapped off, shallow-rooted trees\nknocked over, moving vehicles blown off roads, and small boats\npulled from moorings.\n\nElsewhere across EAST CENTRAL FLORIDA, little to no impact is\nanticipated.",
        "instruction": "* EVACUATIONS:\n\nListen to local official for recommended preparedness actions,\nincluding possible evacuation. If ordered to evacuate, do so\nimmediately.\n\nIf evacuating, leave with a destination in mind and allow extra time\nto get there. Take your emergency supplies kit. Gas up your vehicle\nahead of time. Follow designated evacuation routes. Seek traffic\ninformation on roadway signs, the radio, and from official sources.\n\nLet others know where you are going prior to departure. Secure loose\nitems and pets in the car, and avoid distracted driving.\n\nFor those not under evacuation orders, assess the risk from wind,\nfalling trees, and flooding at your location. If you decide to move,\nrelocate to a safer location nearby. If you do not relocate, help keep\nroadways open for those under evacuation orders.\n\n\n* OTHER PREPAREDNESS INFORMATION:\n\nPreparations to protect life and property should be completed by now.\nEnsure you are in a safe location before the onset of strong winds or\npossible flooding.\n\nIf you are relocating to safe shelter, leave as early as possible.\nAllow extra time to reach your destination. Many roads and bridges\nwill be closed once strong winds arrive. Check the latest weather\nforecast before departing and drive with caution.\n\nKeep cell phones well charged. Cell phone chargers for automobiles\ncan be helpful, but be aware of your risk for deadly carbon monoxide\npoisoning if your car is left idling in a garage or other poorly\nventilated area.\n\nStorm surge is the leading killer associated with tropical storms and\nhurricanes! Make sure you are in a safe area away from the surge\nzone. Even if you are not in a surge-prone area, you could find\nyourself cutoff by flood waters during and after the storm. Heed\nevacuation orders issued by the local authorities.",

The center of\nextremely dangerous major Hurricane Dorian remains nearly stationary\njust to the north of Grand Bahama this evening. Dorian should move\ncloser to the Florida east coast going into Tuesday. While the center\nof Dorian is still forecast to remain offshore, periods of tropical\nstorm force winds with some gusts to hurricane force are expected over\nPalm Beach County through Tuesday night, with the greatest chances\nover the northeastern portion of the county. Occasional tropical storm\nforce wind gusts from squalls are possible over the rest of South\nFlorida through Tuesday evening.\n\nThe threat of life-threatening storm surge exists along the Palm Beach\nCounty coast over the next couple of days, where a storm surge of 3 to\n5 feet above ground level is expected along surge-prone locations\nnorth of Lantana. South of Lantana to Boca Raton, a storm surge of\n2 to 4 feet above ground level is possible. This surge includes the\neffects from some of the wave action from extremely high waves over\nthe offshore Atlantic waters. Coastal Broward County could experience\nstorm surge of 1 to 3 feet above ground level today through the middle\nof this week, while coastal Miami-Dade County could experience a storm\nsurge of 2 feet or less above ground level.\n\nDue to Dorian's close proximity to the Florida east coast, small\nshifts in the track of the hurricane could still bring changes in\nexpected impacts. Residents and visitors in South Florida should\ncontinue to monitor the progress of Hurricane Dorian and follow the\nadvice of local officials.\n\nRegardless of the eventual track of Dorian, major marine and beach\nimpacts are expected along the entire Southeast Florida coast. A\nprolonged period of strong winds over the Atlantic coastal waters will\ncause very hazardous seas, rough surf, and beach erosion through the\nmiddle of the week. Coastal flooding is also possible in vulnerable\nlocations as far south as the Miami-Dade County coast each day through\nthe middle of this week, particularly during the times of high tide.\n\nA few tornadoes are also possible over the next day or so, with the\ngreatest potential along and near the east coast.\n\nPOTENTIAL IMPACTS\n-----------------\n\n* WIND:\nPotential impacts from the main wind event are now unfolding across\nnortheastern and coastal Palm Beach County. Remain well sheltered from\nlife-threatening wind having possible extensive impacts. If realized,\nthese impacts include:\n- Many large trees snapped or uprooted along with fences and\nroadway signs blown over.\n- Some roads impassable from large debris, and more within urban\nor heavily wooded places. Several bridges, causeways, and\naccess routes impassable.\n- Large areas with power and communications outages.\n\nPotential impacts from the main wind event are also now unfolding\nelsewhere across South Florida. Remain well sheltered from\ndangerous wind having possible limited to significant impacts.\n\n* SURGE:\nPotential impacts from the main surge event are now unfolding across\nthe Atlantic coast of Southeast Florida. Remain well away from life-\nthreatening surge having possible significant impacts. If realized,\nthese impacts include:\n- Areas of inundation with storm surge flooding accentuated by\nwaves. Damage to several buildings, mainly near the coast.\n- Sections of near-shore escape routes and secondary roads become\nweakened or washed out, especially in usually vulnerable low\nspots.\n- Major beach erosion with heavy surf breaching dunes. Strong and\nnumerous rip currents.\n- Moderate damage to marinas, docks, boardwalks, and piers.\nSeveral small craft broken away from moorings, especially in\nunprotected anchorages.\n\n\n* FLOODING RAIN:\nPotential impacts from the flooding rain are still unfolding across\nSouth Florida. Remain well guarded against locally hazardous flood\nwaters having possible limited impacts. If realized, these impacts\ninclude:\n- Flood waters can enter a few structures, especially in usually\nvulnerable spots. A few places where rapid ponding of water\noccurs at underpasses, low-lying spots, and poor drainage\nareas. Several storm drains and retention ponds become\nnear-full and begin to overflow. Some brief road and bridge\nclosures.\n\n* TORNADOES:\nPotential impacts from tornadoes are still unfolding across Southeast\nFlorida. Remain well braced against a tornado event having possible\nlimited impacts. If realized, these impacts include:\n- The occurrence of isolated tornadoes can hinder the execution\nof emergency plans during tropical events.\n- A few places may experience tornado damage, along with power\nand communications disruptions.\n- Locations could realize roofs peeled off buildings, mobile\nhomes pushed off foundations or overturned, large tree tops and\nbranches snapped off, shallow-rooted trees knocked over, moving\nvehicles blown off roads, and small boats pulled from moorings.\n\nElsewhere across South Florida, little to no impact is anticipated.",

        "description": "This product covers Northeast Florida and Southeast Georgia\n\n**EXTREMELY POWERFUL HURRICANE DORIAN IS STILL STATIONARY AND\nCONTINUES TO PUMMEL GRAND BAHAMA ISLAND**\n\nNEW INFORMATION\n---------------\n\n* CHANGES TO WATCHES AND WARNINGS:\n- None\n\n* CURRENT WATCHES AND WARNINGS:\n- A Storm Surge Warning and Tropical Storm Watch are in effect\nfor Inland Glynn\n- A Storm Surge Warning and Hurricane Watch are in effect for\nCoastal Camden, Coastal Duval, Coastal Glynn, and Coastal Nassau\n- A Hurricane Warning is in effect for Inland Flagler and Inland\nSt. Johns\n- A Storm Surge Warning and Hurricane Warning are in effect for\nCoastal Flagler and Coastal St. Johns\n- A Tropical Storm Watch is in effect for Inland Camden, Inland\nDuval, and Inland Nassau\n- A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for Clay, Eastern Marion,\nand Putnam\n\n* STORM INFORMATION:\n- About 300 miles southeast of Jacksonville FL or about 270 miles\nsoutheast of St. Augustine FL\n- 26.9N 78.5W\n- Storm Intensity 130 mph\n- Movement Stationary\n\nSITUATION OVERVIEW\n------------------\n\nHurricane Dorian is a powerful and extremely dangerous hurricane with\npeak winds near 130 mph. Dorian has been nearly stationary today and\nhas moved little. By Tuesday, the storm is forecast to turn northwest\nand begin to make its way towards the Florida coast. As Dorian slowly\napproaches, it is forecast to turn north-northwest and parallel the\ncoastline Tuesday into Wednesday.\n\nAt this time, the exact track remains uncertain, and small changes in\nthe forecast track could have large influences on the threat to\nNortheast Florida for damaging winds and life-threatening storm surge.\nShould Dorian approach even closer, it would produce more serious\nimpacts to coastal areas.\n\nListen to local officials and heed evacuation orders as given. Large\nbattering waves and higher than normal tides will add to the\ndestructive potential, along with beach erosion.\n\nHeavy rainfall is forecast over eastern parts of northeast Florida and\ncoastal southeast Georgia and with total accumulations of 4 to\n8 inches, with maximum isolated rainfall amounts to 10 inches along\nthe east coast. Flash flooding is possible, especially in urban and\npoorly drained areas.\n\nPOTENTIAL IMPACTS\n-----------------\n\n* SURGE:\nProtect against life-threatening surge having possible extensive\nimpacts across the beaches of coastal northeast Florida and southeast\nGeorgia. Potential impacts in this area include:\n- Large areas of deep inundation with storm surge flooding\naccentuated by battering waves. Structural damage to buildings,\nwith several washing away. Damage compounded by floating\ndebris. Locations may be uninhabitable for an extended period.\n- Large sections of near-shore escape routes and secondary roads\nwashed out or severely flooded. Flood control systems and\nbarriers may become stressed.\n- Severe beach erosion with significant dune loss.\n- Major damage to marinas, docks, boardwalks, and piers. Many\nsmall craft broken away from moorings, especially in\nunprotected anchorages with some lifted onshore and stranded.\n\n\n* WIND:\nProtect against life-threatening wind having possible extensive\nimpacts across coastal sections of northeast Florida and southeast\nGeorgia. Potential impacts in this area include:\n- Considerable roof damage to sturdy buildings, with some having\nwindow, door, and garage door failures leading to structural\ndamage. Mobile homes severely damaged, with some destroyed.\nDamage accentuated by airborne projectiles. Locations may be\nuninhabitable for weeks.\n- Many large trees snapped or uprooted along with fences and\nroadway signs blown over.\n- Some roads impassable from large debris, and more within urban\nor heavily wooded places. Several bridges, causeways, and\naccess routes impassable.\n- Large areas with power and communications outages.\n\nAlso, protect against dangerous wind having possible limited to\nsignificant impacts across portions of northeast Florida somewhat\ninland of the coast.\n\n* FLOODING RAIN:\nProtect against dangerous rainfall flooding having possible\nsignificant impacts across coastal areas of northeast Florida and\nsoutheast Georgia. Potential impacts include:\n- Moderate rainfall flooding may prompt several evacuations and\nrescues.\n- Rivers and tributaries may quickly become swollen with swifter\ncurrents and overspill their banks in a few places, especially\nin usually vulnerable spots. Small streams, creeks, canals, and\nditches overflow.\n- Flood waters can enter some structures or weaken foundations.\nSeveral places may experience expanded areas of rapid\ninundation at underpasses, low-lying spots, and poor drainage\nareas. Some streets and parking lots take on moving water as\nstorm drains and retention ponds overflow. Driving conditions\nbecome hazardous. Some road and bridge closures.\n\nProtect against locally hazardous rainfall flooding having possible\nlimited impacts across the rest of northeast Florida and southeast\nGeorgia.",
        "instruction": "* EVACUATIONS:\nListen to local official for recommended preparedness actions,\nincluding possible evacuation. If ordered to evacuate, do so\nimmediately.\n\nFor those not under evacuation orders, assess the risk from wind,\nfalling trees, and flooding at your location. If you decide to move,\nrelocate to a safer location nearby. If you do not relocate, help keep\nroadways open for those under evacuation orders.\n\nIf evacuating, leave with a destination in mind and allow extra time\nto get there. Take your emergency supplies kit. Gas up your vehicle\nahead of time.\n\nLet others know where you are going prior to departure. Secure loose\nitems and pets in the car, and avoid distracted driving.\n\n\n* OTHER PREPAREDNESS INFORMATION:\nNow is the time to complete all preparations to protect life and\nproperty in accordance with your emergency plan. Ensure you are in a\nsafe location before the onset of strong winds or possible flooding.\n\nIf heading to a community shelter, become familiar with the shelter\nrules before arrival, especially if you have special needs or have\npets. Take essential items with you from your Emergency Supplies Kit.\n\nKeep cell phones well charged. Cell phone chargers for automobiles\ncan be helpful, but be aware of your risk for deadly carbon monoxide\npoisoning if your car is left idling in a garage or other poorly\nventilated area.\n\nIf you are a visitor, be sure to know the name of the city or town in\nwhich you are staying and the name of the county or parish in which\nit resides. Listen for these locations in local news updates. Pay\nattention for instructions from local authorities.\n\nStorm surge is the leading killer associated with tropical storms and\nhurricanes! Make sure you are in a safe area away from the surge\nzone. Even if you are not in a surge-prone area, you could find\nyourself cutoff by flood waters during and after the storm. Heed\nevacuation orders issued by the local authorities.\n\nIf in a place that is vulnerable to high wind, such as near large\ntrees, a manufactured home, upper floors of a high-rise building, or\non a boat, consider moving to a safer shelter before the onset of\nstrong winds or flooding.\n\nClosely monitor weather.gov, NOAA Weather radio or local news outlets\nfor official storm information. Be ready to adapt to possible changes\nto the forecast. Ensure you have multiple ways to receive weather\nwarnings.\n\n\n* ADDITIONAL SOURCES OF INFORMATION:\n- For information on appropriate preparations see ready.gov\n- For information on creating an emergency plan see getagameplan.org\n- For additional disaster preparedness information see redcross.org",

The hurricane will bring an\nincreased risk for strong winds, storm surge inundation, flash\nflooding, strong rip currents, and dangerous marine conditions to the\nregion.\n\nPOTENTIAL IMPACTS\n-----------------\n\n* SURGE:\nPrepare for life-threatening surge having possible extensive impacts\nacross the coastal counties of Southeast South Carolina and Southeast\nGeorgia.\n\nPotential impacts in this area include:\n- Large areas of deep inundation of saltwater along immediate\nshorelines and in low-lying spots farther inland near rivers\nand creeks, with storm surge flooding accentuated by battering\nwaves. Structural damage to buildings, with several washing\naway. Damage compounded by floating debris. Locations may be\nuninhabitable for an extended period.\n- Large sections of near-shore escape routes and secondary roads\nwashed out or flooded and impassable. Flood control systems and\nbarriers could become stressed.\n- Severe beach erosion with significant dune loss.\n- Major damage to marinas, docks, boardwalks, and piers. Many\nsmall craft broken away from moorings, especially in\nunprotected anchorages, with some lifted onshore and stranded.\n- Drinking water and sewer services negatively impacted.\n- Hazardous containers and materials possibly present in surge\nwaters.\n\nElsewhere across southeast South Carolina and southeast Georgia,\nlittle to no impact is anticipated.\n\n* WIND:\nPrepare for life-threatening wind having possible extensive impacts for\nareas roughly along and east of Interstate 95. Potential impacts in\nthis area include:\n- Considerable roof damage to sturdy buildings, with some window,\ndoor, and garage door failures leading to structural damage.\nMobile homes severely damaged, with some destroyed. Damage\naccentuated by airborne projectiles. Some locations may be\nuninhabitable for weeks.\n- Danger of death or injury from falling objects and airborne\nprojectiles outside.\n- Large trees snapped or uprooted.\n- Some roads impassable from large debris, and more within urban\nor heavily wooded locations. Several bridges and access routes\nimpassable.\n- Large areas with power and communications outages, which could\npersist for days.\n- Several secured small craft could break free from moorings.\n\nAlso, prepare for dangerous wind having possible limited to\nsignificant impacts across interior Southeast South Carolina and\nSoutheast Georgia.\n\n* FLOODING RAIN:\nPrepare for dangerous rainfall flooding having possible significant\nimpacts across coastal areas of Southeast South Carolina and Southeast\nGeorgia. Potential impacts include:\n- Moderate rainfall flooding could prompt some rescues.\n- Rivers and tributaries could quickly become swollen with\nswifter currents and overspill their banks in a few places,\nespecially in normally vulnerable spots. Small streams, creeks,\ncanals, and ditches overflow.\n- Flood waters can enter some structures or weaken foundations.\nSeveral places could experience expanded areas of rapid\ninundation at underpasses, low-lying spots, and poor drainage\nareas. Some streets and parking lots take on moving water as\nstorm drains and retention ponds overflow. Driving conditions\nbecome hazardous. Some road and bridge closures.\n\nPrepare for locally hazardous rainfall flooding having possible\nlimited impacts across interior Southeast South Carolina and Southeast\nGeorgia.\n\n* TORNADOES:\nPrepare for a tornado event having possible limited impacts across\nmainly coastal South Carolina. Potential impacts include:\n- Isolated tornadoes can hinder the execution of emergency plans.\n- Isolated locations could experience tornado damage, along with\npower and communications disruptions.\n- In isolated locations, tornadoes could damage trees, vehicles,\nboats and buildings, especially mobile homes and other poorly\nconstructed structures.\n\nElsewhere across southeast South Carolina and southeast Georgia,\nlittle to no impact is anticipated.\n\n* OTHER COASTAL HAZARDS:\nSevere beach erosion and strong rip currents will occur across the\nbeaches of Southeast South Carolina and Southeast Georgia.",
        "instruction": "* EVACUATIONS:\nListen to local official for recommended preparedness actions,\nincluding possible evacuation. If ordered to evacuate, do so\nimmediately.\n\nFor those not under evacuation orders, assess the risk from wind,\nfalling trees, and flooding at your location. If you decide to move,\nrelocate to a safer location nearby. If you do not relocate, help keep\nroadways open for those under evacuation orders.\n\nIf evacuating, leave with a destination in mind and allow extra time\nto get there. Take your emergency supplies kit. Gas up your vehicle\nahead of time.\n\nLet others know where you are going prior to departure. Secure loose\nitems and pets in the car, and avoid distracted driving.\n\nIf evacuating, follow designated evacuation routes. Seek traffic\ninformation on roadway signs, the radio, and from official sources.\n\n* OTHER PREPAREDNESS INFORMATION:\nNow is the time to check your emergency plan and emergency supplies\nkit and take necessary actions to protect your family and secure your\nhome or business.\n\nWhen making safety and preparedness decisions, do not focus on the\nexact forecast track since hazards such as flooding rain, damaging\nwind gusts, storm surge, and tornadoes extend well away from the\ncenter of the storm.\n\nIf in a place that is vulnerable to high wind, such as near large\ntrees, a manufactured home, upper floors of a high-rise building, or\non a boat, plan to move to safe shelter.\n\nIf you live in a place particularly vulnerable to flooding, such as\nnear the ocean or a large inland lake, in a low-lying or poor\ndrainage area, in a valley, or near an already swollen river, plan to\nmove to safe shelter on higher ground.\n\nAlways heed the advice of local officials and comply with orders that\nare issued. Do not needlessly jeopardize your life or the lives of\nothers.\n\nWhen securing your property, outside preparations should be concluded\nas soon as possible before conditions deteriorate. The onset of\nstrong gusty winds or flooding can cause certain preparedness\nactivities to become unsafe.\n\nBe sure to let friends and family members know of your intentions for\nweathering the storm and your whereabouts. Have someone located away\nfrom the threatened area serve as your point of contact. Share vital\ncontact information with others. Keep cell phones handy and charged.\n\nCheck on those who may not be fully aware of the situation or who are\nunable to make personal preparations.\n\nIf you are a visitor, know the name of the county or parish in which\nyou are located and where it is relative to current watches and\nwarnings. If staying at a hotel, ask the management staff about their\nonsite disaster plan. Listen for evacuation orders, especially\npertaining to area visitors.\n\nClosely monitor weather.gov, NOAA Weather Radio and local news\noutlets for official storm information. Listen for possible changes\nto the forecast.\n\nThere is a threat from tornadoes with this storm. Have multiple ways\nto receive Tornado Warnings. Be ready to shelter quickly.\n\n* ADDITIONAL SOURCES OF INFORMATION:\n- For information on appropriate preparations see ready.gov\n- For information on creating an emergency plan see getagameplan.org\n- For additional disaster preparedness information see redcross.org",
